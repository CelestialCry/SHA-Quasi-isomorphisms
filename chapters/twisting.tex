        In Stasheffs papers \cite{Stasheff63I} and \cite{Stasheff63II}, a strongly homotopy associative algebra, or $A_\infty$-algebra, over a field is a graded vector space together with homogenous linear maps $m_n:A^{\otimes n}\rightarrow A$ of degree $2-n$ satisfying some homotopical relations. This will be made precise later. We will regard $m_2$ to be a multiplication of $A$, but it is however not a priori associative. We choose $m_3$ to be a homotopy of $m_2$'s associator. In this manner, we know that the homotopy of $A$ is an associative algebra. The maps $m_n$ corresponds uniquely to a map $m^c:BA\rightarrow \overline{A}[1]$, which extends to a coderivation $m^c : BA\rightarrow BA$ of the bar construction of $A$. By this relation we could instead define an $A_\infty$-algebra to be a coalgebra on the form $BA$, and we will prefer to do so in this thesis.


        In order to understand the bar construction, we will first study it on associative algebras. Given a differential graded coassociative coalgebra $C$ and a differential graded associative algebra $A$, we say that a homogenous linear transformation $\alpha: C\rightarrow A$ is twisting if it satisfies the Maurer-Cartan equation;
            \begin{equation*}
                \partial\alpha + \alpha\star\alpha = 0.
            \end{equation*}
        Let $\tt{Tw}(C,A)$ be the set of twisting morphisms. By considering it as a functor $\tt{Tw} : \tt{coAlg}_{\mathbb{K}}^{op}\times \tt{Alg}_{\mathbb{K}} \rightarrow Ab$ we want to show that it is represented in both arguments. Moreover, these representations give rise to an adjoint pair of functors, called the bar and cobar construction.

        \begin{center}

            \end{tikzcd}
        \end{center}

        The bar and cobar construction will be the basis for our discussion of $A_\infty$-algebras. As the bar construction can be used to define $A_\infty$-algebras, we may easily dualize this to define $A_\infty$-coalgebras in terms of the cobar construction. This chapter will follow the notions and progression presented in Loday and Vallete \cite{Loday12} to develop the theory for the bar-cobar adjunction.

    \section{Algebras and Coalgebras}    
    \subsection{Algebras}

            This section presents a review of associative algebras over a field $\mathbb{K}$. The main goal of this section is to establish some conventions before we look at how they are dualized to coalgebras. This collection of algebras, together with ring homomorphisms, form the category $\tt{Alg}_{\mathbb{K}}$ of associative algebras over $\mathbb{K}$.

            \begin{definition}[$\mathbb{K}$-Algebra]
                Let $\mathbb{K}$ be a field with unit $1$. A $\mathbb{K}$-algebra $A$, or an algebra $A$ over $\mathbb{K}$, is a vector space with structure morphisms called multiplication and unit,
                \begin{align*}
                    (\cdot_A) & : A\otimes_{\mathbb{K}}A \rightarrow A \\
                    1_A & : \mathbb{K} \rightarrow A,
                \end{align*}
                satisfying the associativity and identity laws. 
                \begin{align*}
                    \text{(associativity)}\quad & (a \cdot_A b) \cdot_A c = a \cdot_A (b \cdot_A c) \\
                    \text{(unitality)}\quad & 1_A(1) \cdot_A a = a = a \cdot_A 1_A(1)
                \end{align*}
                Whenever $A$ does not posess a unit morphism, we will call $A$ a non-unital algebra. In this case only the associativity law must hold.
            \end{definition}

            By abuse of notation we will confuse the unit of $\mathbb{K}$ by the unit of $A$. Since $1_A$ is a ring homomorphism, this should not be a cause of confusion. However, when we want to use the unit as a morphism, we will stick to the $1_A$ notation. When there are no confusion, we will exchange the symbol $(\cdot_A)$ with words in $A$. $(\cdot_A)$ is then concatenation of variables. 

            \begin{definition}[Algebra homomorphisms]
                Let $A$ and $B$ be algebras. Then $f: A\rightarrow B$ is an algebra homomorphism if
                \begin{enumerate}
                    \item $f$ is $\mathbb{K}$-linear
                    \item $f(ab)=f(a)f(b)$
                    \item $f\circ 1_A = 1_B$
                \end{enumerate}
                Whenever $A$ and $B$ are non-unital, we must drop the condition that $f$ preserves units.
            \end{definition}

            \begin{definition}[Category of algebras]
                We let $\tt{Alg}_{\mathbb{K}}$ denote the category of $\mathbb{K}$-algebras. Its objects consists of every algebra $A$, and the morphisms are algebra homomorphisms. The sets of morphisms between $A$ and $B$ are denoted as $\tt{Alg}_{\mathbb{K}}(A,B)$.
                
                Let $\widehat{\tt{Alg}}_{\mathbb{K}}$ denote the category of non-unital algebras. It's objects consists of every non-unital algebra $A$, and the morphisms are non-unital algebra homomorphisms. The sets of morphisms between $A$ and $B$ are denoted as $\widehat{\tt{Alg}}_{\mathbb{K}}(A,B)$.
            \end{definition}

            The cagtegory $(\tt{Mod}_\mathbb{K},\otimes_\mathbb{K},\mathbb{Z})$ is symmetric monoidal. Observe that given any algebra $A$ in $\tt{Mod}_\mathbb{K}$, the triple $(A,(\cdot_A),1_A)$ is a monoid. This gives us an isomorphism of categories, namely that $\tt{Alg}_\mathbb{K}$ is the category of monoids in $\tt{Mod}_\mathbb{K}$. Therefore, the algebra axioms are the following commutative diagrams:
            \begin{center}
                \begin{tikzcd}
                    A \otimes_{\mathbb{K}} A \otimes_{\mathbb{K}} A \ar[]{r}{(\cdot_A)\otimes id_{\mathbb{K}}} \ar[]{d}[]{id_{\mathbb{K}}\otimes (\cdot_A)} & A \otimes_{\mathbb{K}} A \ar[]{d}{(\cdot_A)} \\
                    A \otimes_{\mathbb{K}} A \ar[]{r}[]{(\cdot_A)} & A
                \end{tikzcd} \quad
                \begin{tikzcd}
                    A \otimes_{\mathbb{K}} \mathbb{K} \ar[]{r}[]{id_A \otimes 1_A} \ar[]{rd}[below]{\simeq} & A \otimes_{\mathbb{K}} A \ar[]{d}[]{(\cdot_A)} & \mathbb{K} \otimes_{\mathbb{K}} A \ar[]{l}[above]{1_A \otimes id_A} \ar[]{ld}[]{\simeq}\\
                    & A
                \end{tikzcd}
            \end{center}

            In any symmetric monoidal category $\mathcal{C}$ we may reformulate these defintions by using the monoidal structure more heavily. In section 3 we will introduce electronic circuits, which are inspired by some of the proofs found in \cite{Loday12}. These conventions will give us a graphical calculus of morphisms in $\mathcal{C}$.
            % The final method we will use to represent an algebra are electronic circuits. An electronic circuit is a diagram read from top to bottom, where each column represent a different vector space in a tensor. Morphisms in such diagrams are figures, conjunctions, twistings and etc. E.g. The multiplication operator may be represented as a converging fork, and the unit as a source.

            % \end{center}

            We supply some examples of algebras one may encounter in nature.

            \begin{example}
                Let $\mathbb{K}$ be any field. The field is trivially an algebra over itself.
            \end{example}

            \begin{example}
                The complex numbers $\mathbb{C}$ is an algebra over $\mathbb{R}$. This is true since it is a vector space over $\mathbb{R}$, and complex multiplication respects scalar multiplication.
            \end{example}

            \begin{example}
                Let $\mathbb{K}$ be any field. The ring of n-dimensional matrices $M_n(\mathbb{K})$ is an algebra over $\mathbb{K}$. The multiplication is taken to be the matrix multiplication and the unit is the n-dimensional identity matrix.
            \end{example}

            Augmented algebras will be central to our discussion. An algebra $A$ is augmented if it is equipped with an algebra homomorphism which splits the algebra into an ideal component and a unit component. We make this precise with the following definition

            \begin{definition}[Augmented algebras]
                Let $A$ be an algebra. It is called augmented if there is an algebra homomorphism $\varepsilon_A : A \rightarrow \mathbb{K}$.
            \end{definition}

            Given this algebra homomorphism we know that it has to preserve the unit. Thus the kernel $\tt{Ker}\varepsilon_A \subseteq A$ is almost $A$, but without its unit. In the module category $Mod_\mathbb{K}$ the morphism $\varepsilon_A$ is automatically a split-epimorphism, where the splitting is given by the unit $1_A$. Thus as a module we have $A \simeq \overline{A}\oplus\mathbb{K}$, where $\overline{A} = \tt{Ker}\varepsilon_A$. $\overline{A}$ is called the augmentation ideal, or the reduced algebra of $A$.

            A morphism $f : A \rightarrow B$ of augmented algebras is an algebra homomorphism, but with the added condition that it must preserve the augmentation; i.e. $\varepsilon_B \circ f = \varepsilon_A$. The collection of all augmented algebras over $\mathbb{K}$ together with the morphisms defines the category of augmented algebras over $\mathbb{K}$, $\tt{Alg}_{\mathbb{K},+}$.

            Given an augmented algebra $A$, taking kernels of $\varepsilon_A$ gives a functor $\overline{\underline{\phantom{A}}} : \tt{Alg}_{\mathbb{K},+} \rightarrow \widehat{\tt{Alg}}_\mathbb{K}$. This functor is well defined on morphisms of augmented algebras, as each morphism is required to preserve the splitting. This functor has a quasi-inverse, given by the free augmentation $\argument^+ : \widehat{\tt{Alg}}_\mathbb{K} \rightarrow \tt{Alg}_{\mathbb{K},+}$. Given a non-unital algebra $A$, the free augmentation is defined as $A^+ = A\oplus\mathbb{K}$, where the multiplication is given by:
            \begin{align*}
                (a,k)(a',k') = (aa' + ak' + a'k, kk')\tt{.}
            \end{align*}
            The unit is given by the element $(0,1)$. We summarize this in the statement below.
            
            \begin{proposition}
                The functors $\overline{\underline{\phantom{A}}}$ and $\argument^+$ are quasi-inverse to each other.
            \end{proposition}

            \begin{proof}
                We show that the free augmentation functor is fully-faithfull and essentially surjective. 

                Let $A$ and $B$ be non-unital $\mathbb{K}$-algebras, and let $f,g : A \rightarrow B$ morphisms in $\widehat{\tt{Alg}}_\mathbb{K}$. Suppose that $f^+ = g^+$, then $f = \overline{f^+} = \overline{g^+} = g$. Now suppose that $h : A^+ \rightarrow B^+$, then $h = \overline{h}^+$.

                Suppose that $A\in \tt{Alg}_{\mathbb{K},+}$. We want to show that $A \simeq \overline{A}^+$. As $\mathbb{K}$-modules, $A = \overline{A}^+$, so we propose that $id_A : A \rightarrow \overline{A}^+$ induces an isomorphism. To see that $id_A$ is an algebra homomorphism is to see that the multiplication in $A$ decomposes as $(a_1 + k)(a_2 + l) = (a_1a_2 + a_1l + ka_2) + kl$, where $a_1,a_2\in \overline{A}$ and $k,l \in \mathbb{K}$. The second condition is equivalent to the existence of $\varepsilon_A$. $id_A$ also preserves the augmentation as $\overline{A} \simeq \overline{\overline{A}^+}$.
            \end{proof}

            There are many augmented algebras to encounter in nature. We will note some examples.

            \begin{example}[Group algebra]
                Pick any group $G$ and any field $\mathbb{K}$. The group ring $K[G]$ is an augmented algebra where the augmentation $\varepsilon_{\mathbb{K}[G]} : \mathbb{K}[G] \rightarrow \mathbb{K}$ is given as
                \begin{align*}
                    \varepsilon_{\mathbb{K}[G]}(\sum_{g\in G}k_gg) = \sum_{g\in G}k_g\tt{.}
                \end{align*}
            \end{example}

            Among our most important example of algebras is the tensor algebra. This is also the free algebra over $\mathbb{K}$.

            \begin{example}[Tensor algebra]
                Let $V$ be a $\mathbb{K}$-module. We define the tensor algebra $T(V)$ of $V$ as the module
                \begin{align*}
                    T(V) = \mathbb{K}\oplus V\oplus V^{\otimes 2} \oplus V^{\otimes 3} \oplus \cdots\tt{.}
                \end{align*}
                The tensor algebra is then the algebra consisting of words in $V$. Given two words $v^1..v^i$ and $w^1...w^j$ in $T(V)$ we define the multiplication by the concatenation operation,
                \begin{align*}
                    \nabla_{T(V)} : T(V)\otimes_{\mathbb{K}} T(V) & \rightarrow T(V)\tt{,} \\
                    (v^1...v^i)\otimes(w^1...w^j) & \mapsto v^1...v^iw^1...w^j\tt{.}
                \end{align*}
                The unit is given by including $\mathbb{K}$ into $T(V)$,
                \begin{align*}
                    \upsilon_{T(V)} : \mathbb{K} & \rightarrow T(V)\tt{,} \\
                    1 & \mapsto 1\tt{.}
                \end{align*}
            \end{example}

            Observe that the tensor algebra is augmented. The projection from $T(V)$ into $\mathbb{K}$ is an algebra homomorphism, so we may split the tensor algebra into its unit and its augmentation ideal $T(V) \simeq \mathbb{K}\oplus\overline{T}(V)$. We call $\overline{T}(V)$ the reduced tensor algebra.

            \begin{proposition}[Tensor algebras are free]\label{prop: free-tensor}
                The tensor algebras are the free algebras over the category of $\mathbb{K}$-modules, i.e. for any $\mathbb{K}$-module $V$ there is a natural isomorphism $\tt{Hom}_{\mathbb{K}}(V,A)\simeq \tt{Alg}_{\mathbb{K}}(T(V),A)$.

                The reduced tensor algebra is the free non-unital algebra over the category of $\mathbb{K}$-modules, i.e. for any $\mathbb{K}$-module $V$ there is a natural isomorphism $\tt{Hom}_{\mathbb{K}}(V,A)\simeq \widehat{\tt{Alg}}_{\mathbb{K}}(\overline{T}(V),A)$.
            \end{proposition}

            \begin{proof}
                This proposition should be evident from the description of an algebra homomorphism from a tensor algebra. If $f: T(V) \rightarrow A$ is an algebra homomorphism, then $f$ must satisfy the following conditions:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Unitality:\quad $f(1) = 1$
                    \item Homomorphism property:\quad Given $v,w\in V$, then $f(vw) = f(v)\cdot_Af(w)$
                \end{itemize}
                By induction, we see that $f$ is completely determined by where it sends the elements of $V$. Thus restriction by the inclusion of $V$ into $T(V)$ induces a bijection.
            \end{proof}

            \subsubsection*{Modules}

                Just as for rings, every algebra $A$ has a module category of its own. The definition is very much like that for rings.

                \begin{definition}[Modules]
                    Let $A$ be an algebra over $\mathbb{K}$. A $\mathbb{K}$-module $M$ is said to be a left (right) $A$-module if there exists a structure morphism $\mu_M : A\otimes_{\mathbb{K}}M \rightarrow M$ ($\mu_M : M\otimes_{\mathbb{K}}A \rightarrow M$) called multiplication. We require that $\mu_M$ is associative and preserves the unit of $A$; i.e. we have the commutative diagrams in $Mod_\mathbb{K}$,

                \begin{definition}[A-linear homomorphisms]
                    Let $M,N$ be two left $A$-modules. A morphism $f:M\rightarrow N$ is called $A$-linear if it is $\mathbb{K}$-linear and for any $a$ in $A$ $f(am) = af(m)$.
                \end{definition}

                The category of left $A$-modules is denoted as $Mod_A$, where the morphisms $\tt{Hom}_A(\argument,\argument)$ are $A$-linear. Likewise, the category of right $A$-modules is denoted as $Mod^A$. There is a free functor from the category of $\mathbb{K}$-modules to left $A$-modules.

                \begin{proposition}\label{prop: free-mod}
                    Let $M$ be a $\mathbb{K}$-module. The module $A\otimes_{\mathbb{K}}M$ is a left $A$-module. Moreover, it is the free left module over $\mathbb{K}$-modules, i.e. there is a natural isomorphism $\tt{Hom}_{\mathbb{K}}(M,N)\simeq \tt{Hom}_{A}(A\otimes_{\mathbb{K}}M,N)$.
                \end{proposition}

                \begin{proof}
                    We define natural transformations in each direction and then show that they are inverses.

                    We define morphisms $\phi$ and $\psi$ as
                    \begin{align*}
                        \phi : \tt{Hom}_A(A\otimes_\mathbb{K}M, N) & \rightarrow \tt{Hom}_\mathbb{K}(M,N) \\
                        f & \mapsto f \circ (1_A \otimes M)\tt{,} \\
                        \psi : \tt{Hom}_\mathbb{K}(M, N) & \rightarrow \tt{Hom}_A(A\otimes_\mathbb{K}M, N) \\
                        g & \mapsto \mu_N \circ (A \otimes g)\tt{.}
                    \end{align*}

                    Pick an $f \in \tt{Hom}_A(A\otimes_\mathbb{K}M, N)$, then
                    \begin{align*}
                            \psi\circ\phi (f) = \mu_N \circ (A \otimes \phi (f)) = \mu_N \circ (A \otimes f (1_A \otimes M)) = f (A \otimes M) = f\tt{.}
                    \end{align*}
                    Pick a $g \in \tt{Hom}_\mathbb{K}(M,N)$, then
                    \begin{align*}
                        \phi\circ\psi (g) = \phi (\mu_N \circ (A \otimes g)) = \mu_N \circ (1_A \otimes g) = g\tt{.}
                    \end{align*}
                \end{proof}

                \begin{corollary}
                    $A$ as a left $A$-module is the free left $A$-module over $\mathbb{K}$; i.e. for any left $A$-module $M$, $M \simeq \tt{Hom}_\mathbb{K}(\mathbb{K}, M) \simeq \tt{Hom}_A(A,M)$
                \end{corollary}
            
            \subsubsection*{Categorical structure}

                In order to fully understand the category of algebras, it is convenient to understand what some of the most basic limits and colimits looks like. Unfortunately, the category of algebras, does not have nice kernels and cokernels, so we will restrict our attention to augmented algebras.

                The category of augmented algebras is pointed. The algebra $\mathbb{K}$ is both initial and terminal since we are forced to preserve the unit and counit.

                \begin{definition}
                    Let $A$ and $B$ be augmented algebras. Their direct sum $A \oplus B$ is defined as the following limit:
                    \begin{center}
                        \begin{tikzcd}
                            A \oplus B \ar[]{r}[]{} \ar[]{d}[]{} \ar[phantom]{rd}[near start]{\ulcorner} & B \ar[]{d}[]{\varepsilon_B} \\
                            A \ar[]{r}[]{\varepsilon_A} & \mathbb{K}
                        \end{tikzcd}
                    \end{center}
                \end{definition}

                Since $\mathbb{K}$ is terminal, then $A \oplus B$ is the product in $\tt{Alg}_{\mathbb{K},+}$. Since we may calculate this limit as a kernel, this is in fact a subobject of $A \oplus B$ in the sense of modules. One may observe the following relation between the direc sum and the ordinary direct sum.

                \begin{lemma}
                    Given augmented algebras $A$ and $B$, then $A \oplus B \simeq (\overline{A} \oplus \overline{B})^+$, where on the right hand side we use the ordinary direct sum of the underlying modules.
                \end{lemma}

                \begin{proof}
                    This is clear.
                \end{proof}

                One should also observe that the injections $A \hookrightarrow A \oplus B$ and $B \hookrightarrow A \oplus B$ does not satisfy the universal property of the coproduct. Thus, the direct sum is no longer the coproduct in this category.

                \begin{definition}
                    Given two augmented algebras $A$ and $B$, the free product $A\ast B$ is defined as the following colimit:
                    \begin{center}
                        \begin{tikzcd}
                            \mathbb{K} \ar[]{r}[]{\upsilon_A} \ar[]{d}[]{\upsilon_B} \ar[phantom]{rd}[near end]{\lrcorner} & A \ar[]{d}[]{} \\
                            B \ar[]{r}[]{} & A \ast B
                        \end{tikzcd}
                    \end{center}
                \end{definition}
                
                Like before, the free product is defined to be the coproduct. We will see that this is in fact a free product of augmented algebras. For commutative algebras, this case is very simple, and the coproduct of $A$ and $B$ is $A \otimes_{\mathbb{K}}B$. \todo{citation needed?}. 

                \begin{lemma}
                    Given two augmented algebras $A$ and $B$, then $A\ast B \simeq \sfrac{T(\overline{A}\oplus \overline{B})}{I}$ which is the tensor algebra over the direct sum of the underlying non-unital algebras. $I$ is an ideal generated by elements $\langle a\otimes a' - a\cdot a',b\otimes b' - b\cdot b' \rangle$.
                \end{lemma}

                \begin{proof}
                    We have naturally injective linear morphisms
                    \begin{align*}
                        \iota_A : A & \hookrightarrow T(\overline{A}\oplus \overline{B})\tt{,} \\ 
                        a & \mapsto a\tt{,} \\
                        1 & \mapsto 1\tt{.}
                    \end{align*}
                    This is in fact a ring homomorphism since $\iota_A(aa') = aa' = a\otimes a' = \iota_A(a)\iota_A(a')$.

                    Suppose we have the following diagram.
                    \begin{center}
                        \begin{tikzcd}
                            A \ar[bend right]{rd}[below]{f} \ar[hook]{r}[below]{\iota_A} & T(\overline{A}\oplus \overline{B}) \ar[dashed]{d}[]{h} \ar[hookleftarrow]{r}[below]{\iota_B} & B \ar[bend left]{ld}[]{g} \\
                            & T
                        \end{tikzcd}
                    \end{center}
                    By functoriality we obtain a morphism $h = T(\overline{f}\oplus \overline{g}) : T(\overline{A} \oplus \overline{B}) \rightarrow T$. By unitality and augmentation property forces this to act as the identity on the respective identities. Clearly $f = h \iota_A$ and $g = h \iota_B$.

                    Assume there exists another $h' : T(\overline{A}\oplus \overline{B}) \rightarrow T$ such that $f = h' \iota_A$ and $g = h' \iota_B$. Then $h = h'$ on $A \oplus B$ part of $T(\overline{A}\oplus \overline{B})$. Since $h'$ is a ring morphism, $h = h'$ on all of $T(\overline{A}\oplus \overline{B})$.
                \end{proof}

    \subsection{Coalgebras}
            In this section we want to dualize the definitions given in the last section. As we will see, some strange artifacts from the structure of algebras appears in the dualization process. We would like to define a coalgebra as an algebra, but where all of the diagrams are reversed. For many purposes this dualization is good, but as we will observe, some finiteness conditions are necessary. The category of "ill-behaved" coalgebras will be denoted $\tt{coAlg}_\mathbb{K}$, and we will look at this first.

            \begin{definition}[$\mathbb{K}$-Coalgebra]
                Let $\mathbb{K}$ be a field. A coalgebra $C$ over $\mathbb{K}$ is a $\mathbb{K}$-module with structure morphisms called comultiplication and counit,
                \begin{align*}
                    (\Delta_C) & : C \rightarrow C\otimes_{\mathbb{K}}C \\
                    \varepsilon_C & : C \rightarrow \mathbb{K},
                \end{align*}
                satisfying the coassociativity and coidentity laws. 
                \begin{align*}
                    \text{(coassociativity)} \quad & (\Delta_C\otimes id_C)\circ\Delta_C(c) = (id_C\otimes\Delta_C)\circ\Delta_C(c) \\
                    \text{(counitality)} \quad & (id_C\otimes\varepsilon_C)\circ\Delta_C(c) = c = (\varepsilon_C\otimes id_C)\circ\Delta_C(c)
                \end{align*}
            \end{definition}

            In the same way as for algebras, we say that a coalgebra is non-counital if it is without a counit.

            Unlike algebras, coalgebras does not admit a single intuitive method for writing repeated application of the comulitplication. For instance, given an element $c\in C$, we may apply the comultiplication twice on $c$ in two different ways:
            \begin{align*}
                \Delta_{C,(1)}^2(c) & = (\Delta_C \otimes C)\Delta_C(c)\tt{,} \\
                \Delta_{C,(2)}^2(c) & = (C \otimes \Delta_C)\Delta_C(c)\tt{.}
            \end{align*}
            One should immediately note that $\Delta_{C,(1)}^2(c) = \Delta_{C,(2)}^2(c)$ is coassociativity. Hence there is in fact a unique way to do repeated application of $\Delta_C$ on $c$. We denote the $n$-fold repeated application of $\Delta_C$ by $\Delta_C^n$. Since the element $\Delta_C^n(c)$ represents a finite sum in $C^{\otimes n}$, one may use Sweedlers notation \cite{Loday12}, as it is well-defined,
            \begin{align*}
                \Delta_C^n(c) = \sum c_{(1)}\otimes ... \otimes c_{(n)}\tt{.}
            \end{align*}
            
            % We may dualize the electronic circuits of an algebra to coalgebras. In this manner our structure morphisms would be upside down relative to the algebra morphisms. Thus comultiplication becomes a diverging fork and counit becomes a sink.

            \begin{definition}[Coalgebra homomorphism]
                Let $C$ and $D$ be coalgebras. Then $f:C\rightarrow D$ is a coalgebra morphism if
                \begin{enumerate}
                    \item $f$ is $\mathbb{K}$-linear
                    \item $(f\otimes f)\circ\Delta_C(c) = \Delta_D(f(c))$
                    \item $\varepsilon_D \circ f = \varepsilon_C$
                \end{enumerate}
                Whenever $C$ and $D$ are non-counital, we only require 1. and 2. for a homomorphism of non-counital coalgebras.
            \end{definition}

            \begin{definition}[Category of coalgebras]
                Let $\tt{coAlg}_{\mathbb{K}}$ denote the category of coalgebras. Its objects consists of coalgebras $C$, and the morphisms are coalgebra homomorphisms. The set of morphisms between $C$ and $D$ are denoted as $\tt{coAlg}_{\mathbb{K}}(C,D)$.
                
                Let $\widehat{\tt{coAlg}}_{\mathbb{K}}$ denote the category of non-counital algebras. Its objects consists of non-counital algebras $C$, and the morphisms are non-uconital coalgebra homomorphisms. The set of morphisms between $C$ and $D$ are denoted as $\widehat{\tt{coAlg}}_{\mathbb{K}}(C,D)$.
            \end{definition}

            At a first glance, coalgebras may seem weird and unnatural, but they appear many places in nature.

            \begin{example}[$\mathbb{K}$ as a coalgebra]
                The field $\mathbb{K}$ can be given a coalgebra structure over itself. Since $\{1\}$ is a basis for $\mathbb{K}$ we define the structure morphisms as
                \begin{align*}
                    \Delta_{\mathbb{K}}(1) & = 1\otimes 1 \\
                    \varepsilon(1) & = 1.
                \end{align*}
                One may check that these morphisms are indeed coassociative and counital. Thus we may regard our field as either an algebra or a coalgebra over itself.
            \end{example}

            \begin{example}[$\mathbb{K}{[G]}$ as a coalgebra]
                The group algebra has a natural coalgebra structure. We may take duplication of group elements as the comultiplication, i.e.
                \begin{align*}
                    \Delta_{\mathbb{K}[G]}(kg) = kg\otimes g\tt{.}
                \end{align*}
                Coincidentally we have already defined the counit, this is the augmentation $\varepsilon_{\mathbb{K}[G]}$ for the group algebra $\mathbb{K}[G]$. Recall that this was
                \begin{align*}
                    \varepsilon_C(\sum k_gg) = \sum k_g\tt{.}
                \end{align*}
                One may see that these morphisms satisfy coassociativity and counitality.
            \end{example}
            \begin{example}[The linear dual coalgebra]
                Let $M$ be any finite dimensional $\mathbb{K}$-module. There is a natural isomorphism $\xi : M^* \otimes_\mathbb{K} M^* \rightarrow (M \otimes_\mathbb{K} M)^*$, given on elementary tensors as
                \begin{align*}
                    \xi(f \otimes g)(m \otimes n) = f(m)g(n)\tt{.}
                \end{align*}

                Let $A$ be a finite dimensional algebra, then its linear dual $A^*$ is a coalgebra. The linear dual of the multiplication $(\cdot_A)$ is defined as 
                \begin{align*}
                    (\cdot_A)^* : A^* \rightarrow (A\otimes_\mathbb{K}A)^*\tt{.}
                \end{align*}
                We define the comulitplication of $A^*$ as $\xi^{-1}(\cdot_A)^*$.

                The counit of $A^*$ is the morphism $1_A^*$.
            \end{example}

            Before we state our main example, we will first introduce its essential structure.

            \begin{definition}[Coaugmented coalgebras]
                Let $C$ be a coalgebra. $C$ is coagumented if there is a coalgebra homomorphism $\eta_C:\mathbb{K}\rightarrow C$.
            \end{definition}

            Similar to augmented algebras, each coaugmented coalgebra splits in the category $Mod_\mathbb{K}$. We first notice that given a coalgebra homomorphism $f$, the cokernel $\tt{Cok}f$ is also a coalgebra. This is some induced quotient structure. Given a coaugmentation $\eta_C : \mathbb{K} \rightarrow C$, we call $\tt{Cok}\eta_C = \overline{C}$ for the coaugmentation quotient or reduced coalgebra of $C$. Then we obtain the splitting $C \simeq \overline{C}\oplus\mathbb{K}$. The reduced coproduct, denoted $\overline{\Delta}_C$ may explicitly be given as
            \begin{align*}
                \overline{\Delta}_C(c) = \Delta_C(c) - 1\otimes c - c\otimes 1\tt{.}
            \end{align*}

            \begin{example}[Tensor Coalgebras]
                Let $V$ be a $\mathbb{K}$-module. We define the tensor coalgebra $T^c(V)$ of $V$ as the module
                \begin{align*}
                    T^c(V) = \mathbb{K}\oplus V\oplus V^{\otimes 2}\oplus V^{\otimes 3}\oplus \cdots\tt{.}
                \end{align*}
                Given a string $v^1...v^i$ in $T(V)$ we define the comultiplication by the deconcatenation operation,
                \begin{align*}
                    \Delta_{T^c(V)}:T^c(V) & \rightarrow T^c(V)\otimes_{\mathbb{K}}T^c(V) \\
                    v^1...v^i & \mapsto 1\otimes(v^1...v^i) + (\sum_{j=1}^{i-1} (v^1...v^{j})\otimes(v^{j+1}...v^i)) + (v^1...v^i)\otimes 1\tt{.}
                \end{align*}
                The counit is given by projecting $T^c(V)$ onto $\mathbb{K}$,
                \begin{align*}
                    \varepsilon_{T^c(V)} : T^c(V) & \rightarrow \mathbb{K} \\
                    1 & \mapsto 1 \\
                    v^1...v^i & \mapsto \tt{.}
                \end{align*}
            \end{example}

            We observe that the tensor coalgebra is coaugmented. Its coaugmentation is given by the inclusion of $\mathbb{K}$ into $T^c(V)$. We can split $T^c(V) \simeq \mathbb{K}\oplus \overline{T}^c(V)$, where $\overline{T}^c(V)$ denotes the reduced tensor coalgebra.

            Cofreeness does not come for free for the tensor coalgebra. Our problem is a mismatch in the behavior of algebras and coalgebras. The problem arises when we try to do evaluation. Suppose that $A$ is an algebra and that we have $n$ elements of $A$, i.e. an element of $A^{\otimes n}$. On this element we may apply the multiplication of $A$ a maximum of $n$-times, we cannot multiply an element with nothing non-trivially. However, given an element in a coalgebra $C$, we may use the comultiplication on this element $n$ times, $n+1$ times and so on ad infinitum. In the coalgebra we may comultiply an element possibly an infinite amount of times. This is a property which is sometimes ill-behaved with our dualization of algebras to coalgebras. 
            
            However, when we dualized the tensor algebra to the tensor coalgebra we did not lose this property, that an element may only be comultiplied a finite number of times. This is due to the composition of $T^c(V)$ as a direct sum of $V^{\otimes n}$, i.e. any element is a finite sum of finite tensors.
            
            This extra assumption we need for coalgebras will be called conilpotent. Let $C \simeq \mathbb{K} \oplus \overline{C}$ be a coaugmented coalgebra, we define the coradical filtration of $C$ as a filtration $Fr_0C \subseteq Fr_1C \subseteq ... \subseteq Fr_rC \subseteq ...$ by the submodules:
            \begin{align*}
                Fr_0C & = \mathbb{K} \\
                Fr_rC & = \mathbb{K} \oplus \{c\in\overline{C}\mid \forall n\geq r, \overline{\Delta}_C(c) = 0\}.
            \end{align*}

            \begin{definition}[Conilpotent coalgebras]
                Let $C$ be a coaugmented coalgebra. We say that $C$ is conilpotent if its coradical filtration is exhaustive, i.e.
                \begin{align*}
                    \varinjlim_rFr_rC \simeq C\tt{.}
                \end{align*}
                The full subcategory of conilpotent coalgebras will be denoted as $\tt{coAlg}_{\mathbb{K},conil}$.
            \end{definition}
            
            \begin{proposition}[Conilpotent tensor coalgebra]\label{prop: conilpotent-tensor}
                Let $V$ be a $\mathbb{K}$-module. The tensor coalgebra $T^c(V)$ is conilpotent.
            \end{proposition}

            \begin{proof}
                Let $v\in V$, then $\Delta_{T^c(V)}(v)=1\otimes v + v\otimes 1$ and $\overline{\Delta}_{T^c(V)}(v)=0$. We then observe the following:
                \begin{align*}
                    Fr_0T^c(V) & = \mathbb{K}\tt{,} \\
                    Fr_1T^c(V) & = \mathbb{K} \oplus V\tt{,} \\
                    Fr_rT^c(V) & = \bigoplus_{i\leq r} V^{\otimes i}\tt{.}
                \end{align*}
                This shows that the coradical filtration is exhaustive.
            \end{proof}

            \begin{proposition}[Cofree tensor coalgebra]\label{prop: cofree-tensor}
                The tensor coalgebra is the cofree conilpotent coalgebra over the category of $\mathbb{K}$-modules, i.e. for any $\mathbb{K}$-module $V$ and any conilpotent coalgebra $C$ there is a natural isomorphism $\tt{Hom}_{\mathbb{K}}(\overline{C}, V)\simeq \tt{coAlg}_{\mathbb{K}, conil}(C, T^c(V))$.
            \end{proposition}

            \begin{proof}
                This proposition should be evident from the description of a coalgebra homomorphism into the a tensor coalgebra. If $g:C\rightarrow T^c(V)$ is a coalgebra homomorphism, then $g$ must satisfy the following conditions:
                \begin{enumerate}
                    \item (Coaugmentation)\quad $g(1)=1$,
                    \item (Counitality)\quad Given $c\in \overline{C}$ then $\varepsilon_{T^c(V)}\circ g(c)=0$,
                    \item (Homomorphism property)\quad Given $c\in C$ then $\Delta_{T^c(V)}(g(c))=(g\otimes g)\circ\Delta_C(c)$.
                \end{enumerate}

                We will construct the maps for the isomorphism explicitly. If $g:C\rightarrow T^c(V)$ is a coalgebra homomorphism, then composing with projection gives a map $\pi\circ g:C\rightarrow V$. Note that $\pi\circ g(1)=0$, so this is essentially a map $\pi\circ g:\overline{C}\rightarrow V$. For the other direction, let $\overline{g}:\overline{C}\rightarrow V$. We will then define $g$ as
                \begin{align*}
                    g = id_{\mathbb{K}} \oplus \sum_{i=1}^{\infty}(\otimes^{i}\overline{g})\overline{\Delta}_C^{i-1}.
                \end{align*}
                Observe that $g$ is well defined, since convergence of the sum follows from conilpotency of $C$. One may then check that $g$ is a coalgebra homomorphism, which yields the result.
            \end{proof}

            Essential to our dualization are comodules. We quickly give a definition of them.

            \begin{definition}[Comodules]
                Let $C$ be a coalgebra. A $\mathbb{K}$-module $M$ is said to ba left (right) $C$-comodule if there exist a structure morphism $\omega_M: M \rightarrow C\otimes_{\mathbb{K}}M$ ($\omega_M: M \rightarrow M\otimes_{\mathbb{K}}C$) called comultiplication. We require that $\omega_M$ is coassociative with respect to the comultiplication of $C$ and preserves the counit of $C$; i.e. we have the following commutative diagrams in $Mod_\mathbb{K}$,

                    \sum g(c)_{(1)}\otimes g(c)_{(2)} = \sum c_{(1)}\otimes g(c_{(2)})\tt{.}
                \end{align*}
            \end{definition}

            The category of left $C$-comodules is denoted as $\tt{CoMod}_C$, where the morphisms $\tt{Hom}_C(\argument,\argument)$ are $C$-colinear. We would also like to restrict our attention to those $C$-comodules which are conilpotent, i.e. those comodules which have an exhaustive coradical filtration. The coradical filtration is defined analogously, as we only care for the $\mathbb{K}$-module structure. Notice that for conilpotent coalgebras this requirement is automatic. Likewise, the category of right $C$-comodules is denoted as $\tt{CoMod}^C$.

            \begin{proposition}\label{prop: cofree-comod}
                Let $M$ be a $\mathbb{K}$-module. The module $C\otimes_{\mathbb{K}}M$ is a left $C$-comodule. Moreover, it is the cofree left comodule over $\mathbb{K}$-modules, i.e. there is an isomorphism $\tt{Hom}_{\mathbb{K}}(N,M)\simeq \tt{Hom}_C(N,C\otimes_{\mathbb{K}}M)$. 
            \end{proposition}

            \begin{proof}
                This is dual to proposition \ref{prop: free-mod}. We only give the isomorphism, its validity is clear.

                \begin{align*}
                    \phi' : \tt{Hom}_C(N,C\otimes_\mathbb{K}M) & \rightarrow \tt{Hom}_\mathbb{K}(N,M) \\
                    f & \mapsto (\varepsilon_C \otimes M) \circ f\tt{,} \\
                    \psi' : \tt{Hom}_\mathbb{K}(N,M) & \rightarrow \tt{Hom}_C(N,C\otimes_\mathbb{K}M) \\
                    g & \mapsto (C \otimes g) \circ \omega_N\tt{.}
                \end{align*}
            \end{proof}

            \begin{corollary}
                $C$ as a left $C$-comodule is the cofree $C$-comodule over $\mathbb{K}$; i.e. for any left $C$-comodule $N$, $N^* \simeq \tt{Hom}_\mathbb{K}(N,\mathbb{K}) \simeq \tt{Hom}_C(N, C)$.
            \end{corollary}

    \subsection{Electronic Circuits}
            Calculations involving both algebras and coalgebras tends to become convoluted and unmanagable. Since we want to study the interplay between algebras and coalgebras using other tools to write down equations can be handy. We will develop the graphical calculus briefly mentioned in \cite{Loday12}. This graphical calculus will consists of string diagrams, refered to as electronic circuits, which describes function compositions of tensors. Since we only care about the interplay of tensors, we may develop this graphical calculus in any closed symmetric monoidal category. Why do we want to introduce this abstraction? A closed symmetric monoidal category is a good category to model functions, or morphisms, which may take several variables in its argument. Moreover, in the next section we are going to switch categories. Thus the same notions may be applied and the differences are only seen in the implementations.
            
            The definition of a closed symmetric monoidal category may be found in the appendix \todo{Skriv appendix?}. We recall that it is a category $\mathcal{C}$ together with a bifunctor $\argument\otimes\argument : \mathcal{C}\times\mathcal{C}\rightarrow\mathcal{C}$ usually called tensor, and a unit object $Z\in \mathcal{C}$. We are also given four natural isomorphisms relating the functors and the unit to what they are meant to be:
            \begin{align*}
                \tt{Associator} & \quad \alpha : (A \otimes B) \otimes C \rightarrow A \otimes (B \otimes C)\tt{.}\\
                \tt{Right unit} & \quad \rho : A \otimes Z \rightarrow A\tt{.}\\
                \tt{Left unit} & \quad \lambda : Z \otimes A \rightarrow A\tt{.}\\
                \tt{Braiding/Symmetry} & \quad \beta : A \otimes B \rightarrow B \otimes A\tt{.}
            \end{align*}
            These natural isomorphisms are supposed to satisfy some laws as well. See the appendix for the full definition.

            In an electronic circuit we want to rewrite equations, possibly involving tensors, into string diagrams. To illustrate with some simple examples, let $f : A \rightarrow B$, $g : B \rightarrow C$ and $h : D \rightarrow E$. We may consider the composition
            \begin{align*}
                (g \otimes E) \circ (f \otimes h) : A \otimes D \rightarrow C \otimes E \tt{.}
            \end{align*}
            An electronic circuit is written from top to bottom and is composed of levels. This means that the first morphisms which we apply will be at the top, descending downwards with each function composition. We write each argument in the composition as its own string. Thus this example above will look like the circuit below. Notice how $f$ and $h$ are at the same level, indicating that they should be thought of as $f \otimes h$. Thus an $\otimes$ indicates a change of string, while a $\circ$ indicates a change of level.
            
            Beware that when many tensors are used, we should really remember how each string is tensored. We may call adding tensors for horizontal composition and composition of morphism for vertical composition. Both of these have a choice in how we associate them, but both have unique choices up to isomorphism given by the associator.

                    \node[op, scale = 0.75] (f1) at (0,0) {f};
                    \node[op, scale = 0.75] (g1) at (0,-1) {g};

                \end{tikzpicture}
            \end{center}

            The true power of electronic circuit comes to light when we consider morphisms that in some sense "creates" or "destroys" strings. For example a morphism of 2 variables in some sense "destroys" a string by applying them to each other. Consider now a morphism $f : A \otimes B \rightarrow C$, we represent this morphism in an electronic circuit by using a converging fork. Likewise, "creation" of strings is seen as a diverging fork.
            \begin{center}
                \begin{tikzpicture}[line cap=round,line join=round,>=triangle 45,x=1cm,y=1cm, thick, op/.style={circle, draw, scale=0.75}, scale=0.7]
                    \node[op, scale = 0.75] (f1) at (0,0) {f};
                    
                    \draw [line width = 1pt] (-0.5,0.75) -- (-0.5, 0.5) -- (f1) -- (0, -0.5);
                    \draw [line width = 1pt] (0.5,0.75) -- (0.5, 0.5) -- (f1) -- (0,-0.5);
                \end{tikzpicture}
            \end{center}

            We may write the unit object $Z$ without any strings in a circuit. By the right and left unit, an object is isomorphic to itself tensored with the unit. In this manner, whenever we have a morphism entering or exiting the unit $Z$ we start a new string by using a sink or a source. For example, consider $f$ as before and a morphism $g : Z \rightarrow A$, then we may write $f \circ (g \otimes B)$ as the circuit below. Notice that again this is only well-defined up to isomorphism by the right and left unit.
            \begin{center}
                \begin{tikzpicture}[line cap=round,line join=round,>=triangle 45,x=1cm,y=1cm, thick, op/.style={circle, draw, scale=0.75}, scale=0.7]
                    \node[op, scale = 0.75] (f1) at (0,0) {f};
                    \node[op, scale = 0.75] (g1) at (-0.5, 1) {g};
                    \node[op, scale =  0.76] (s1) at (-0.5, 1.75) {};

                    \draw [line width = 1pt] (s1) -- (g1) -- (-0.5, 0.5) -- (f1) -- (0, -0.5);
                    \draw [line width = 1pt] (0.5,2) -- (0.5, 0.5) -- (f1) -- (0,-0.5);
                \end{tikzpicture}
            \end{center}

            The final operation we have is braiding. Whenever we apply the braiding morphism on the tensors, we may simply denote this as interchanging the strings. For example, $\beta_{A,B} : A \otimes B \rightarrow B \otimes A$ is the circuit below. Notice that by naturality of $\beta$, we may move a braiding along the circuit. In this manner, if we have two braids, they may undo each other. A braid may also be moved to either end, and in this manner they may be ignored during calculations.
            \begin{center}
                \begin{tikzpicture}[line cap=round,line join=round,>=triangle 45,x=1cm,y=1cm, thick, op/.style={circle, draw, scale=0.75}, scale=0.7]
                    \draw [line width = 1pt] (0, 1.25) -- (0, 0.75) -- (1, 0.25) -- (1, -0.25);
                    \draw [line width = 1pt] (1,1.25) -- (1, 0.75) -- (0, 0.25) -- (0,-0.25);
                \end{tikzpicture}
            \end{center}

            With the language of electronic circuits, we may now write down the axioms of an algebra or coalgebra by circuits. The axioms states the existence of morphisms, as well as commutativity of some diagrams. We may do this electronically. The structure maps of algebras and coalgebras will be given special notation, since we will use these often.

            For convenience we will let $\mathcal{C} = \tt{Mod}_\mathbb{K}$. This is a closed symmetric monoidal category, with $\otimes_\mathbb{K}$ as $\otimes$. Recall that an algebra is a $\mathbb{K}$-module $A$ together with maps $(\cdot_A) : A \otimes A \rightarrow A$ and $1_A : \mathbb{K} \rightarrow A$. These morphisms will be denoted electronically as the diagrams below.
            \begin{center}
                \begin{tikzpicture}[line cap=round,line join=round,>=triangle 45,x=1cm,y=1cm, thick, op/.style={circle, draw, scale=0.75}, scale=0.7]

                    \draw [line width  = 1pt] (0.5, 0.75) -- (0.5 , 0.25) -- (0,0);

                \end{tikzpicture}
                \qquad
                \begin{tikzpicture}[line cap=round,line join=round,>=triangle 45,x=1cm,y=1cm, thick, op/.style={circle, draw, scale=0.75}, scale=0.7]

            This notation will be adopted for our algebras and coalgebras when convenient. This will compactify the notation for comultiplication and make tensors more readable. Moreover, the intuiton for algebras is easier to dualize to coalgebras with this notation. One simply has to work out an algebra statement and then turn the diagram upside down to make it into a coalgebra statement.

            Previously we talked about braiding and how that relates to interchanging strings. In the same manner that we have a horizontal and vertical associator, we also have a vertical and horizontal braiding. The braiding we first encountered is the horizontal braiding. The vertical braiding refers then to function composition of tensors. This manifests in electronic circuits as sliding a morphism along a string. Whenever the given braiding of $\mathcal{C}$ is nice enough we can get away by ignoring it whenever we move a morphism along a string. For instance, look at the category of $\mathbb{K}$-modules where we may define the braiding on elementary tensors as $\beta (a\otimes b) = b\otimes a$. In this case the braiding is agnostic to how we move our morphisms along a string. This means that we have the following equality of circuits.

            However, in nature we may encounter a braiding which is not nice enough. Here we should take a step back to figure out how we can move morphisms along strings, before we continue to use this graphical calculus of function composition. We will meet such a braiding soon.
            

    \subsection{Derivations and DG-Algebras}
            This section aims to define differential graded algebras and their modules. Given an algebra $A$, we may define a derivation as a map satisfying the Leibniz rule. In the dual case for a coalgebra we may define a coderivation as a map satisfying the Zinbiel rule, but for brevity we will refer to these maps as derivations. Once we get a grasp on how to make derivations we introduce graded algebras and modules, to equip these with derivations. This will give us the categories of differential graded algebras and chain complexes. Throughout this section we will also develop electronic circuits for these notions.

            \begin{definition}[Derivations and Coderivations]
                Let $M$ be an $A$-bimodule. A $\mathbb{K}$-linear morphism $d:A\rightarrow M$ is called a derivation if $d(ab)=d(a)b+ad(b)$, i.e. electronically,

            We remark that this translation between equations and electronic circuits is not at the same level of generalization. Due to this, the electronic circuit description has more advantages as it allows us to think with elements when we are really only dealing with morphisms. This will later be abused, to derive results which is e.g. independent of the given braiding on the category.

            A useful fact about derivations is that they will always map the identity to $0$. We obtain this from Leibniz rule as one would get $d(1) = 2d(1)$, and thus $d(1) = 0$.

            \begin{proposition}\label{prop: tensor-derivation}
                Let $V$ be a $\mathbb{K}$-module and $M$ be a $T(V)$-bimodule. A $\mathbb{K}$-linear morphism $f:V\rightarrow M$ uniquely determines a derivation $d_f:T(V)\rightarrow M$, i.e. there is an isomorphism $\tt{Hom}_{\mathbb{K}}(V,M)\simeq \tt{Der}(T(V),M)$.


                Let $N$ be a $T^c(V)$-bicomodule. A $\mathbb{K}$-linear morphism $g:M\rightarrow V$ uniquely determines a coderivation $d_g^c:N\rightarrow T^c(V)$, i.e. there is an isomorphism $\tt{Hom}_{\mathbb{K}}(N,V)\simeq \tt{Coder}(N,T^c(V))$.
            \end{proposition}

            \begin{proof}
                Let $a_1\otimes ... \otimes a_n$ be an elementary tensor of $T(V)$. We define a map $d_f : T(V) \rightarrow M$ as
                \begin{align*}
                    d_f(a_1\otimes ... \otimes a_n) & = \sum_{i=1}^n a_1...f(a_i)...a_n \\
                    d_f(1) & = 0\tt{.} 
                \end{align*}
                $d_f$ is a derivation by defintion.
                
                Restriction to $V$ gives the natural isomorphism. Let $i : V\rightarrow T(V)$, then $i^*d_f = f$. Let $d : T(V) \rightarrow M$ be a derivation, then $d_{i^*d}=d$. Suppose that $g: M \rightarrow N$ is a morphism between $T(V)$-bimodules, then naturality follows from bilinearity.

                In the dual case, $d_g^c : N \rightarrow T^c(V)$ is a bit tricky to define. Let $\omega^l_N:N\rightarrow N\otimes T^c(V)$ and $\omega^r_N : N\rightarrow T^c(V) \otimes N$ denote the coactions on $N$. Since $T^c(V)$ is conilpotent, we get the same kind of finiteness restrictions on $N$. Define the reduced coactions as $\overline{\omega}^l_N = \omega^l_N - \argument\otimes 1$ and $\overline{\omega}^r_N = \omega^r_N - 1\otimes\argument\ $, this is well-defined by coassociativity. Observe that for any $n\in N$ there are $k$ and $k'>0$ such that ${\overline{\omega}^{l^k}_N}(n) = 0$ and ${\overline{\omega}^{r^{k'}}_N}(n)=0$.

                Let $n_{(k)}^{(i)}$ denote the extension of $n$ by $k$ coactions at position $i$, i.e. 
                \begin{align*}
                    n_{(k)}^{(i)} = \overline{\omega}^{r^i}_N\overline{\omega}^{l^{k-i}}_N(n)\tt{.} 
                \end{align*}
                The extension of $n$ by $k$ coactions is then the sum over every position $i$,
                \begin{align*}
                    n_{(k)} = \sum_{i=0}^kn_{(k)}^{(i)}\tt{.}
                \end{align*} 
                Observe that $n_{(0)} = n$. The grade of $n$ may be thought of as the smallest $k$ such that $n_{(k)}$ is zero. This grading gives us the coradical filtration of $N$, and it is exhaustive by the finiteness restrictions given above. With this notion, every element of $N$ may be given a finite grade.

                If $g: N \rightarrow V$ is a linear map, we may think of it as a map sending every element of $N$ to an element of $T^c(V)$ of grade $1$. To get a map which sends element of grade $k$ to grade $k$, we must extend the morphism. Let $\pi : T^c(V) \rightarrow V$ be the linear projection and define $g_{(k)}^{(i)} = \pi\otimes ... \otimes g \otimes \pi$ as a morphism which of $k$ tensors which is $g$ at the $i$-th argument, but the projection otherwise. $d_g^c$ is then defined as the sum over each coaction and coordinate,
                \begin{align*}
                    d_g^c(n) = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \sum_{i=0}^k g_{(k)}^{(i)}(n_{(k)}^{(i)})\tt{.}
                \end{align*}
                
                Upon closer inspection we may observe that this is the dual construction of the derivation morphism. It is well-defined as the sum is finite by the finiteness restrictions. The map is a coderivation by duality, and the natural isomorphism is given by composition with the projection map $\pi$.
            \end{proof}

            We now wish to get into the territory of derivations as we know them from homological algebra. This is obtained by choosing an algebra and equipping it with a derivation. This will give us a universal derivation to work with when we want to define a differential on a graded module.

            \begin{definition}[Differential algebra]
                Let $A$ be an algebra. We say that $A$ is a differential algebra if it is equipped with a derivation $d:A\rightarrow A$. Dually, a coalgebra $C$ is called a differential coalgebra if it is equipped with at least one coderivation $d:C\rightarrow C$.
            \end{definition}

            \begin{definition}[A-derivation]
                Let $(A,d_A)$ be a differential algebra and $M$ a left $A$-module. A $\mathbb{K}$-linear morphism $d_M:M\rightarrow M$ is called an $A$-derivation if $d_M(am)=d_A(a)m + ad_M(m)$, or electronically,

                Let $A$ be a differential algebra and $M$ a $\mathbb{K}$-module. A $\mathbb{K}$-linear morphism $f:M\rightarrow A\otimes_{\mathbb{K}} M$ uniquely determines a derivation $d_f:A\otimes M\rightarrow A\otimes M$, i.e. there is an isomorphism $\tt{Hom}_{\mathbb{K}}(M,A\otimes_{\mathbb{K}}M)\simeq \tt{Der}(A\otimes_{\mathbb{K}}M)$. Moreover, $d_f$ is given as $((\cdot_A)\otimes id_M)\circ (id_A\otimes f) + d_A\otimes id_M$.

                Dually, if $C$ is a differential coalgebra and $N$ is a $\mathbb{K}$-module, then a $\mathbb{K}$-linear morphism $g:C\otimes N\rightarrow N$ uniquely determines a coderivation $d_g:C\otimes_{\mathbb{K}}N\rightarrow C\otimes_{\mathbb{K}}N$. There is an isomorphism $\tt{Hom}_{\mathbb{K}}(C\otimes_{\mathbb{K}}N,N)\simeq \tt{Coder}(C\otimes_{\mathbb{K}}N)$, and $d_g$ is given as $(id_C\otimes g)\circ (\Delta_C\otimes id_N) + d_C\otimes id_N$.
            \end{proposition}

            \begin{proof}
                This is only proved in the case of an algebra. The case of a coalgebra is dual.
                
                We first got to prove that the morphism $d_{\argument} : \tt{Hom}_\mathbb{K}(M, A\otimes_\mathbb{K}M) \rightarrow \tt{Der}(A \otimes_\mathbb{K}M)$ is well-defined. This means to check that for any morphism $f : M \rightarrow A \otimes_\mathbb{K} M$ the morphism $d_f$ satisfies the Leibniz rule.

                Assume that we have elements $a, b \in A$ and $m\in M$. Then $d_f(ab\otimes m) = d_f(a(b\otimes m))$. We now make an abuse of notation to write an equality between an element and a circuit. Recall that this really means that we have to think of $a$, $b$ and $m$ as generalized elements,

                Next we show that $d_{\argument}$ has an inverse. This is given by "restriction to $M$", also known as 
                \begin{align*}
                    (1_A\otimes M)^* : \tt{Hom}_\mathbb{K}(A\otimes_\mathbb{K}M, N) \rightarrow \tt{Hom}_\mathbb{K}(M, N)\tt{.}
                \end{align*}
                Let $f : M \rightarrow A\otimes_\mathbb{K} M$ be a linear map and $D : A\otimes_\mathbb{K} M \rightarrow A\otimes_\mathbb{K} M$ be a derivation, then a quick calculation verifies that $d_{\argument}$ is inverse to restriction.

            \end{proof}

            We are now going to slowly work our way towards the context of homological algebra. We say that a $\mathbb{K}$-module $M^*$ admits a $\mathbb{Z}$-grading if it decomposes into either summands or factors
            \todo{Gir dette mening å definere?}
            \begin{align*}
                M^* = \bigoplus_{z:\mathbb{Z}}M^z\tt{ or } M^* = \prod_{z:\mathbb{Z}}M^z\tt{.}
            \end{align*}
            An element of $m\in M$ is said to be homogenous if it is properly contained in a single summand, i.e. $m\in M^n$. $m$ is then said to have degree $n$. We say that a morphism of graded modules $f:M^*\rightarrow N^*$ is homogenous of degree $n$ if it preserves the grading, i.e.  $f(M^i) \subseteq N^{n+i}$. The degree of a homogenous element $m$ or morphism $f$ is denoted as $|m|$ or $|f|$.
            
            There is a distinction between the ordinary and self-enriched category of graded modules. We are going to work with the self-enriched category, and its hom-objects is the graded module of homogenous morphism. We denote a factor in the grading as $\tt{Hom}_\mathbb{K}^w(M^*,N^*)=\startset{f : M^* \rightarrow N^* \mid f\tt{ is homogenous and }|f|=w}$, so the graded hom is
            \begin{align*}
                \tt{Hom}_\mathbb{K}^* = \prod_{w\in\mathbb{Z}}\tt{Hom}_\mathbb{K}^w\tt{.}
            \end{align*}
            The ordinary hom-objects are the hom-objects of the underlying modules, $\tt{Hom}_\mathbb{K}(M,N)$. This category is denoted as $\tt{Mod}_\mathbb{K}^*$. In general and whenever it makes sense, we denote $\mathcal{C}^*$ as the category of $\mathbb{Z}$-graded objects from $\mathcal{C}$.

            The category $\tt{Mod}_\mathbb{K}^*$ is a closed symmetric monoidal category. The tensor is given by the following formula, using the ordinary tensor of $\tt{Mod}_\mathbb{K}$,
            \begin{align*}
                M^*\otimes N^* = \bigoplus_{n\in \mathbb{Z}}\bigoplus_{p\in\mathbb{Z}}M^p\otimes_\mathbb{K} N^q\tt{, where }q = n - p\tt{.}
            \end{align*}
            The associator of $\tt{Mod}_\mathbb{K}$ may be lifted to this tensor. The unit is the module $\mathbb{K}^* \simeq \mathbb{K}$ concentrated in degree $0$. The right and left unit transformation may also be lifted from $\mathbb{K}$. 
            
            The category $\tt{Mod}_\mathbb{K}^*$ is closed. This means that our graded tensor fixed in one variable is left adjoint to the graded hom. We may obtain the graded hom as a right adjoint for the other variable as well by using the braiding which we will define later. Showing closedness is a routine calculation by using the tensor-hom adjunction from $\tt{Mod}_\mathbb{K}$.
            \begin{multline*}
                \tt{Hom}_\mathbb{K}^*(A^*\otimes B^*, C^*) = \prod_{w\in\mathbb{Z}}\prod_{n\in\mathbb{Z}}\tt{Hom}_\mathbb{K}^w(\bigoplus_{p\in\mathbb{Z}}A^p\otimes_\mathbb{K}B^{n-p},C^n) \\
                = \prod_{w\in\mathbb{Z}}\prod_{n\in\mathbb{Z}}\prod_{p\in\mathbb{Z}}\tt{Hom}_\mathbb{K}(A^p\otimes B^{n-(p+w)},C^n) \simeq \prod_{w\in\mathbb{Z}}\prod_{n\in\mathbb{Z}}\prod_{p\in\mathbb{Z}}\tt{Hom}_\mathbb{K}(A^p,\tt{Hom}_\mathbb{K}(B^{n-(p+w),C^n})) \\
                \simeq \prod_{w\in\mathbb{Z}}\prod_{p\in\mathbb{Z}}\tt{Hom}_\mathbb{K}(A^p, \prod_{n\in\mathbb{Z}}\tt{Hom}_\mathbb{K}(B^{n-(p+w),C^n})) = \prod_{w\in\mathbb{Z}}\prod_{p\in\mathbb{Z}}\tt{Hom}_\mathbb{K}(A^p,\tt{Hom}_\mathbb{K}^{p+w}(B^*,C^*)) \\
                = \prod_{w\in\mathbb{Z}}\tt{Hom}_\mathbb{K}^w(A^*,\tt{Hom}_\mathbb{K}^*(B^*,C^*)) = \tt{Hom}_\mathbb{K}^*(A^*,\tt{Hom}_\mathbb{K}^*(B^*,C^*))\tt{.}
            \end{multline*}
            
            We give a braiding on homogenous elementary tensors as
            \begin{align*}
                \beta(a\otimes b) = (-1)^{|a||b|}b\otimes a\tt{.}
            \end{align*}
            It is immediate that $\beta_{A,B}$ is inverse to $\beta_{B,A}$. Observe that this category also admits a braiding where we don't introduce a sign. This does however not work when we want to add differentials to our graded modules, so this is why we stick with this sign. This braiding is also commonly known as the Koszul sign convention. 

            Since $\tt{Mod}_\mathbb{K}^*$ is a closed symmetric monoidal category it admits electronic circuits. Thus the previous results which we have proved by electronic circuits also apply to this category, as the proof is identical in this language. One should note that the specific implementation may be different as vertical braiding may work different. We will now study the vertical braiding in more detail. By definition \cite{Kelly05} the application of two homogenous morphisms $f : A \rightarrow A'$ and \\ $g : B \rightarrow B'$ on elements $a \in A$ and $b\in B$ on tensors is
            \begin{align*}
                (f\otimes g)(a\otimes b) = (-1)^{|g||a|}f(a)\otimes g(b)\tt{.}
            \end{align*}
            Viewing $a$ and $b$ as generalized elements again, we get Koszul sign rule on morphisms, i.e. given homogenous composable morphisms $f,f',g,g'$ we get that
            \begin{align*}
                (f' \otimes g')\circ(f\otimes g) = (-1)^{|g'||f|}(f'\circ f)\otimes (g'\circ g)\tt{.}
            \end{align*}
            Electronically we may represent this as a $2$-string circuit where a morphism on the left wants to downwards pass a morphism on its right,

            A good way of thinking about moving components in a circuit is that whenever we move a component downwards it has to pass over every component to the left of it on its current level, and every component to the right of it on the level below. Thus, in a $2$-string component we may say that if we move a component downwards to-, or completely past another component to its right, a sign is introduced. If we move a component upwards completely past another component to its left, we introduce a sign. In an $n$-string circuit it gets more complicated as the component may have to move past components on both the left and right side.

            Unlike the other electronic equations in which we may substitute parts of an electronic circuit with other equal parts this does not however work a priori in this context. This is because how we defined levels. If we are given a $3$-string circuit, then the formula changes, this is because we want to manipulate every element on a level simultanously. In the case of moving a left-most component downwards pass many components, we may regard them as a component on a single string. We will use this to prove a interchange of components on an $n$-string circuit formula.
            
            \begin{proposition}\label{prop: multi-koszul-sign}
                Let $n \geq 1$ and suppose that we have $a_i\in A_i \rightarrow B_i$ and $b_i: B_i \rightarrow C_i$ for any $0 < i \leq n $. Then we get that
                \begin{align*}
                    (b_i\circ a_i) \otimes \cdots \otimes (b_n \circ a_n) & = (-1)^s(b_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes b_n)\circ (a_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes a_n)\tt{,} \\

                We prove this by induction. If $n=1$ this is true. $s = 0$ since the sum is empty, so $b_1 \circ a_1  =(-1)^s b_1 \circ a_1$.
                
                Assume that the conclusion holds for $n-1$, and that we have $a_i$ and $b_i$ as in the hypothesis. Let $s' = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1}|b_i|(\sum_{1\leq j < i}|a_j|)$, then
                \begin{align*}
                    s = s' + |b_n|(\sum_{i = 1}^{n-1}|a_i|)\tt{.}
                \end{align*}
                The conclusion follows from this calculation.
                \begin{multline*}
                    (b_1 \circ a_1) \otimes \cdots \otimes (b_n \circ a_n) = (-1)^{s'}((b_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes b_{n-1}) \circ (a_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes a_{n-1})) \otimes (b_n \circ a_n) \\ = (-1)^{s' + |b_n|(\sum_{i = 1}^{n-1}|a_i|)}(b_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes b_n) \circ (a_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes a_n)\tt{.}
                \end{multline*}
            \end{proof}

            A final remark on this braiding is that it affects any scenario where we compose functions and they move past each other. Since function composition factors through this tensor, moving functions around is actually a braiding. An important example of this is the pre-composition functor. If $f$ and $g$ are homogenous and composable, then
            \begin{align*}
                f^*(g) = (-1)^{|f||g|}g\circ f\tt{.}
            \end{align*}

            The graphical calculus we have developed will be the same for any symmetric monoidal category where the braiding is similar. What this means will soon be evident when we add extra structure to the objects of $\tt{Mod}_\mathbb{K}^*$.

            A graded $\mathbb{K}$-module $M^\bullet$ is called a cochain complex if it comes equipped with a differential $d_M : M^\bullet \rightarrow M^\bullet$. By a differential we mean a homogenous morphism of degree $1$ such that $d_M^2 = 0$. Be cautious of bad notation, as $d^2_M$ might mean $d^2_M = d_M \circ d_M$ and $d^2_M : M^2 \rightarrow M^3$.

            Given a cochain complex $M^\bullet$, we know by definition that the image of the differential lies inside the kernel of the differential. We denote this at the $i$'th coordinate as $B^iM \subseteq Z^iM$. $B^*M$ is the graded submodule of images, also called boundaries. $Z^*M$ is the graded submodule of kernels, also called cycles. The graded cohomology module $H^*M$ is defined as the quotient $\sfrac{Z^*M}{B^*M}$. A cochain complex is said to be exact if $H^*M \simeq 0$.

            Cochain complexes are plentiful in nature.
            \begin{example}[$\mathbb{K}$ as a cochain complex]
                Let $\mathbb{K}^\bullet = (\mathbb{K}, 0)$ be the graded $\mathbb{K}$-module concentrated in degree $0$ together with a $0$ differential. This is trivially a cochain complex.
            \end{example}
            \begin{example}[Trivial cochain complexes]
                Let $M^*$ be a graded $\mathbb{K}$-module. Let $M^\bullet = (M^*, 0)$ be the same graded module with the $0$ differential, this is also a cochain complex.
            \end{example}
            \begin{example}
                We can create a chain complex as the following diagram.
                \begin{center}
                    \begin{tikzcd}

                \end{center}
            \end{example}
            \begin{example}[Cone of a chain map]
                Suppose that $f : A^\bullet \rightarrow B^\bullet$ is a homogenous morphism of degree $0$ such that $f\circ d_A = d_B\circ f$. There is a cochain complex associated to $f$, yielding a short-exact sequence of cochain complexes. We define $\tt{cone}(f)$ at each degree by
                \begin{align*}
                    \tt{cone}(f)^n = A^{n+1} \oplus B^{n}\tt{,} \\
                    d_{\tt{cone}(f)}^n = \begin{pmatrix}
                        d_A^{n+1} & 0 \\ f^{n+1} & d_B^n
                    \end{pmatrix}\tt{.}
                \end{align*}
                This gives us a short exact sequence,

            \begin{example}[Normalized cochain complex]
                Let $A : \Delta^{op} \rightarrow \tt{Mod}_\mathbb{K}$ be a simplicial $\mathbb{K}$-module. \todo{No sources?} We define a collection of diagrams $J^n$ as $J^0 = A_0$, and every other as
                \begin{center}
                    \begin{tikzcd}
                        J^n = A_n \ar[bend left, yshift = 2.5ex]{r}[]{0}\ar[yshift = 1.5ex]{r}[]{d_1} \ar[phantom]{r}[]{\vdots} \ar[yshift = -2ex]{r}[below]{d_{n}} & A_{n-1}
                    \end{tikzcd}
                \end{center}
                $A$'s normalized cochain complex is the complex given as
                \begin{align*}
                    NA^{-n} = \varprojlim J^n\tt{.}
                \end{align*}
                In a complete pointed category, such as $\tt{Mod}_\mathbb{K}$, the limit is the same as the intersection of every kernel:
                \begin{align*}
                    \varprojlim J^n = \bigcap_{i=1}^n\tt{Ker}d_i\tt{.}
                \end{align*}
                The differential of $NA$ is given as $d_0$. Since we have turned the complex around, this is a morphism of degree $1$. By taking the limit we force $d_0^2 = 0$ as well.
            \end{example}
            \begin{example}[Associated cochain complex]
                Let $A : \Delta^{op} \rightarrow \tt{Mod}_\mathbb{K}$ be a simplical $\mathbb{K}$-module. We define a differential as
                \begin{align*}
                    d = \sum_{i=0}^n(-1)^id_i\tt{.}
                \end{align*}
                Let $\tt{C}A$ be the complex given in each degree as
                \begin{align*}
                    \tt{C}A^{-n} = A_n\tt{.}
                \end{align*}
                $d$ defines a differential on $\tt{C}A$ of degree $1$.
            \end{example}
            \begin{example}[Singular chain complex with $\mathbb{K}$-coefficents]
                Let $M$ be a topological space. There is a simplical set defined as $\tt{Sing}(M) = \tt{Top}(\Delta^{\argument},M) : \Delta^{op} \rightarrow \tt{Set}$. Here $\Delta^{[n]}$ in Top refers to the topological standard $n$-simplex. We get a simplical $\mathbb{K}$-module by creating the free one, $\mathbb{K}\tt{Sing}(M)$. By the above example defines a chain complex in $\tt{Mod}_\mathbb{K}$.
            \end{example}

            We make a distinction for some cochain complexes which is of particular interest.
            
            \begin{definition}[Almost free cochain complexes]
                Suppose that $M^\bullet$ is a cochain complex. We say that $M^\bullet$ is almost free if the underlying graded module $M^*$ is free, i.e. a tensor algebra.

                Likewise, we say that $M^\bullet$ is almost cofree if $M^*$ is cofree, i.e. a tensor coalgebra.
            \end{definition}

            The category of cochain complexes will be denoted as $\tt{Mod}_\mathbb{K}^\bullet$. Note that this category is built upon $\tt{Mod}_\mathbb{K}^*$, and we inherit the braiding $\beta$. It can be shown that this is the only braiding which will make the tensors of this category well-defined. For this category we would like to entertain different collections of morphisms. This is because the morphisms which respects all of the structure and the morphisms which makes this category self-enriched are different. We will usually denote both of these categories as $\tt{Mod}_\mathbb{K}^\bullet$, but when we want to emphesize the structure preserving maps we will rather denote this as $\tt{Ch}(\mathbb{K})$.

            When $A^\bullet$ and $B^\bullet$ are cochain complexes the graded $\mathbb{K}$-module $\tt{Hom}_\mathbb{K}^*(A^\bullet, B^\bullet)$ admits a derivative. Let $f : A^\bullet \rightarrow B^\bullet$ be any homogenous morphism, then the derivative-, or boundary of $f$ is given by
            \begin{align*}
                \partial f = [d, f] = (d_{B*} + d_A^*)(f) = d_B \circ f - (-1)^{|f|}f\circ d_A\tt{.}
            \end{align*}
            We see that $|\partial| = |d_{B*} + d_A^*| = 1$, and
            \begin{align*}
                \partial^2f = (d_{B*} + d_A^*)(d_B \circ f - (-1)^{|f|}f\circ d_A) = d_B^2f + (-1)^{|f|}d_Bfd_A - (-1)^{|f|}d_Bfd_A - fd_A^2 = 0\tt{.}
            \end{align*}
            Thus, $\tt{Hom}_\mathbb{K}^\bullet(A^\bullet, B^\bullet) = (\tt{Hom}_\mathbb{K}^*(A^\bullet, B^\bullet), \partial)$ is a cochain complex. We endow $Mod_\mathbb{K}^\bullet$ with these hom-objects. In an electronic diagram we write $\partial f$ as a sum of circuits,

            \end{center}

            Notice how this construction of $\tt{Hom}_\mathbb{K}^\bullet$ is the same as the (product) total complex of an anti-commutative double complex. An anti-commutative double complex is a graded module of cochain complexes, together with a differential between the cochain complexes. These different differentials are supposed to anti-commute. An anti-commutative double complex may be illustrated in this manner.
            \begin{center}
                \begin{tikzcd}

                    & \vdots \ar[]{u}[]{d_C^v} & \vdots \ar[]{u}[]{d_C^v} & \vdots \ar[]{u}[]{d_C^v}
                \end{tikzcd}
            \end{center}
            Another way of thinking of an anti-commutative double complex $C^{\bullet, \bullet}$ is that it is a bigraded $\mathbb{K}$-module with a vertical and horizontal differential such that $d^v_C\circ d^h_C = -d^h_C \circ d^v_C$.

            \begin{definition}
                Let $C^{\bullet, \bullet}$ be an anti-commutative double complex. We define the sum and product total complex. The differential at each $C^{p,q}$ is defined as $d_{\tt{Tot}C} = d^v_C + d^h_C$, and
                \begin{align*}
                    \tt{Tot}^{\oplus}(C^{\bullet, \bullet}) & = \bigoplus_{n\in\mathbb{Z}}\bigoplus_{p+q=n}C^{p,q}\tt{,} \\
                    \tt{Tot}^{\prod}(C^{\bullet, \bullet}) & = \prod_{n\in \mathbb{Z}}\prod_{p+q=n}C^{p,q}\tt{.}
                \end{align*}
            \end{definition}
            
            If $C^{\bullet, \bullet}$ is bounded, then $\tt{Tot}^\oplus(C^{\bullet, \bullet}) \simeq \tt{Tot}^{\prod}(C^{\bullet, \bullet})$.

            If we let $\tt{Hom}_\mathbb{K}(A^\bullet, B^\bullet)^{\bullet, \bullet} = (\prod_{p,q\in\mathbb{Z}}\tt{Hom}_\mathbb{K}(A^p,B^q), d_A^*, d_{B*})$, then it is clear that
            \begin{align*}
                \tt{Hom}_\mathbb{K}^\bullet(A^\bullet,B^\bullet) = \tt{Tot}^{\prod}(\tt{Hom}_\mathbb{K}(A^\bullet, B^\bullet)^{\bullet, \bullet})\tt{.}
            \end{align*}

            From this we are able to deduce that $\tt{Mod}_\mathbb{K}^\bullet$ is a closed symmetric monoidal category. The tensor may be deduced from the data of $\tt{Hom}_\mathbb{K}^\bullet$. Define an anti-commutative double complex $(A^\bullet \otimes_\mathbb{K} B^\bullet)^{\bullet, \bullet} = (\bigoplus_{n\in\mathbb{Z}}\bigoplus_{p+q=n}A^p\otimes B^q, d_A\otimes B,A\otimes d_B)$, then the tensor is defined as
            \begin{align*}
                A^\bullet \otimes B^\bullet = \tt{Tot}^\oplus((A^\bullet \otimes B^\bullet)^{\bullet, \bullet})\tt{.}
            \end{align*}
            It is clear that this tensor is left adjoint to $\tt{Hom}_\mathbb{K}^\bullet$. All of the structure morphisms for a closed symmetric monoidal category are inherited from $\tt{Mod}_\mathbb{K}^*$. This also means that $\tt{Mod}_\mathbb{K}^\bullet$ employs the same electronic circuits as $\tt{Mod}_\mathbb{K}^*$.

            The category of cochain complexes with chain maps $\tt{Ch}(\mathbb{K})$ is defined to have its hom-objects as $Z^0\tt{Hom}_\mathbb{K}^\bullet(A^\bullet, B^\bullet)$. By abuse of notation we may write $\tt{Ch}(\mathbb{K}) = Z^0\tt{Mod}_\mathbb{K}^\bullet$. Notice that this condition means that the derivative of any morphism $f : A^\bullet \rightarrow B^\bullet$ in $\tt{Ch}(\mathbb{K})$ is $0$; i.e. that $\partial f = 0$, or $f\circ d_A = d_B \circ f$. We will call these morphisms for chain maps.

            The homotopy category $\tt{K}(\mathbb{K})$ is defined to be the quotient category of $\tt{Ch}(\mathbb{K})$ at null-homotopic chain maps. Observe that $\tt{K}(\mathbb{K}) = H^0\tt{Mod}_\mathbb{K}^\bullet$. This is definitional, because the chain maps $f, g : A^\bullet \rightarrow B^\bullet$ are homotopic if there is a homogenous morphism $h : A^\bullet \rightarrow B^\bullet$ of degree $-1$ such that $\partial h = f - g$.

            A chain map $f : A^\bullet \rightarrow B^\bullet$ induces homogenous morphisms of degree $0$.
            \begin{align*}
                B^*f & : B^*A \rightarrow B^*B \\
                Z^*f & : Z^*A \rightarrow Z^*B \\
                H^*f & : H^*A \rightarrow H^*B
            \end{align*}
            We say that $f$ is a quasi-isomorphism if $H^*f$ is an isomorphism. This is equivalent to say that $\tt{cone}(f)$ is exact.

            A cochain complex $N^\bullet$ is said to be contractible if $id_N$ is null-homotopic. Then it follows for any other cochain complexes $M^\bullet$ that $H^0\tt{Hom}_\mathbb{K}^\bullet(M^\bullet, N^\bullet) \simeq 0$.

            We define the shift functor $\argument [n] : \tt{Mod}_\mathbb{K}^\bullet \rightarrow \tt{Mod}_\mathbb{K}^\bullet$ is defined on cochains $M^\bullet$ as
            \begin{align*}
                (M^\bullet, d_M)[n] = (M^\bullet[n], (-1)^nd_M)\tt{.}
            \end{align*}
            With this definition, shifting is naturally isomorphic to tensoring. That is if $\mathbb{K}^\bullet[n]$ denotes the field concentrated in dimension $-n$, then
            \begin{align*}
                \mathbb{K}^\bullet[n]\otimes_\mathbb{K} M^\bullet \simeq M^\bullet[n]\simeq M^\bullet\otimes_\mathbb{K}\mathbb{K}^\bullet[n]\tt{.}
            \end{align*}
            By writing out the total tensor product, one may see how the differential gets its sign. We usually call $\argument[1]$ shifting, desuspension or looping; and $\argument[-1]$ for inverse-shifting, suspension or delooping.

            We are now ready to talk about algebras in $Mod_\mathbb{K}^\bullet$.

            \begin{definition}[Differential graded algebra]
                $(A^\bullet,d_A)$ is a differential graded algebra if:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item $A^\bullet$ is a differential algebra in $\tt{Mod}_\mathbb{K}^\bullet$.
                    \item The structure morphisms $(\cdot_A)$ and $1_A$ are chain maps.
                    \item The derivation and differential coincides.
                \end{itemize}
            \end{definition}

            \begin{example}[The unit]
                $\mathbb{K}^\bullet = (\mathbb{K},0)$ is a differential graded algebra in the trivial way. It is concentrated in degree $0$ and the differential is the trivial derivation.
            \end{example}
            \begin{example}[De Rham complex]
                Given a manifold $M$, the exterior algebra $\Omega M$ is a differential graded algebra. See Tu \cite{Tu07} for a thouough explanation.
            \end{example}

            Given a differential graded, or dg-algebra $A^\bullet$, we may form the category of left $A^\bullet$-modules, $\tt{Mod}_A$.
            \begin{definition}
                $M^\bullet$ is a left $A^\bullet$-module if
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item $M^\bullet$ is a cochain complex,
                    \item there is a chain map $\mu_M : A^\bullet\otimes_\mathbb{K} M^\bullet$ satisfying associativity and unitality,
                    \item $d_M$ is an $A^\bullet$-derivation.
                \end{itemize}
            \end{definition}
            The hom-objects are defined analogously. We use $\tt{Hom}_{A^\bullet}^\bullet$ to denote the $\mathbb{K}$-linear cochain complex.

            With this definition the categories $\tt{Mod}_\mathbb{K^\bullet}$ and $\tt{Mod}_\mathbb{K}^\bullet$ is the same category. This is because a chain complex already satisfy the first two bullet points by definition. Being a $\mathbb{K}^\bullet$-derivation is trivial, so every map satisfies this.

            We also have the dual definition to obtain dg-coalgebras and their comodules.
            
            \begin{definition}
                $C^{\bullet}$ is a differential graded coalgebra if
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item $C^\bullet$ is a differential coalgebra in $\tt{Mod}_\mathbb{K}^\bullet$,
                    \item the structure morphisms $\Delta_C$ and $\varepsilon_C$ are chain maps,
                    \item the coderivation and differential coincides
                \end{itemize}
            \end{definition}

            \begin{definition}
                $N^\bullet$ is a left $C^\bullet$-comodule if
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item $N^\bullet$ is a cochain complex,
                    \item there is a chain map $\omega_C : N^\bullet \rightarrow C^\bullet \otimes_\mathbb{K} N^\bullet$ satisfying coassociativity and counitalit,
                    \item $d_N$ is a $C^\bullet$-coderivation.
                \end{itemize}
            \end{definition}

            By these definitions we may extend proposition \ref{prop: free-derivation} to the category of cochain complexes.

            \begin{corollary}\label{cor: dg-free-derivation}
                Let $A^\bullet$ be a differential graded algebra and $M^\bullet$ a cochain complex. A homogenous $\mathbb{K}$-linear morphism $f:M\rightarrow A\otimes_{\mathbb{K}} M$ uniquely determines a derivation \\ $d_f:A\otimes M\rightarrow A\otimes M$ of same degree, i.e. there is an isomorphism \\ $\tt{Hom}_{\mathbb{K}}^*(M^\bullet,A^\bullet\otimes_{\mathbb{K}}M^\bullet)\simeq \tt{Der}^*(A^\bullet\otimes_{\mathbb{K}}M^\bullet)$. Moreover, $d_f$ is given as $(\nabla_{A^\bullet}\otimes id_M)\circ (id_A\otimes f) + d_{A\otimes M}$.

                Dually, if $C^\bullet$ is a differential graded coalgebra and $N^\bullet$ is a cochain complex, then a homogenous $\mathbb{K}$-linear morphism $g:C^\bullet\otimes N^\bullet\rightarrow N^\bullet$ uniquely determines a coderivation \\ $d_g:C^\bullet\otimes_{\mathbb{K}}N^\bullet\rightarrow C^\bullet\otimes_{\mathbb{K}}N^\bullet$. There is an isomorphism $\tt{Hom}_{\mathbb{K}}^*(C^\bullet\otimes_{\mathbb{K}}N^\bullet,N^\bullet)\simeq \tt{Coder}^*(C^\bullet\otimes_{\mathbb{K}}N^\bullet)$, and $d_g$ is given as $(id_C\otimes g)\circ (\Delta_{C^\bullet}\otimes id_N) + d_{C\otimes N}$.
            \end{corollary}

            \begin{proof}
                The same electronic circuits as in the proof of proposition \ref{prop: free-derivation} suffice to prove this statement.
            \end{proof}

            It is notable that this statement carries an additional two duals. That is we have the same result when we consider right modules as well. The same proof applies in these cases.
    \section{Cobar-Bar Adjunction}
    \subsection{Convolution Algebras}

            Given a coalgebra $C$ and an algebra $A$, we obtain a special product on the hom-object $\tt{Hom}_\mathbb{K}(C,A)$ by twisting the comulitplication and multiplication together. The convolution algebra forms the backbone of our proof of the cobar-bar adjunction.

            Let $C$ be a coalgebra and $A$ an algebra, then if $f,g:C\rightarrow A$ is a $\mathbb{K}$-linear morphism we may define $f\star g = (\cdot_A)(f\otimes g)\Delta_C$. This operation is called $\star$ convolution.

            \begin{proposition}[Convolution algebra]
                The $\mathbb{K}$-module $\tt{Hom}_{\mathbb{K}}(C,A)$ is an associative algebra when equipped with convolution $\star:\tt{Hom}_{\mathbb{K}}(C,A)\rightarrow \tt{Hom}_{\mathbb{K}}(C,A)$. The unit is given by $1 \mapsto \upsilon_A\circ\varepsilon_C$.

                \end{center}
            \end{proof}

            This proof does not rely on braiding and lifts to any closed symmetric monoidal category.

            If we are given an algebra $A$, then it may be considered as a differential algebra with the the trivial derivation. That is, $(A, 0)$ is a differential algebra. For such structures, the set of $A$-derivations is precisely the set of $A$-linear morphisms. Dually, every coalgebra $C$ may be thought of as a differential coalgebra. 
            
            We may apply a trivialization of proposition \ref{prop: free-derivation} to $A$ and $C$ considered as differential (co)algebra. When we look at the module $C\otimes_\mathbb{K}A$, it is both free over $A$ on the right and cofree over $C$ on the left. Consider a morphism $\alpha : C \rightarrow A$, then there are two ways to extend $\alpha$ to obtain a (co)derivation. Precomposing with $C$'s comultiplication gives us a morphism from $C$ to the free $A$-module $C\otimes_\mathbb{K} A$,

            \begin{align*}
                (id_C\otimes \alpha) \circ \Delta_C : C \rightarrow C \otimes_\mathbb{K} A\tt{.}
            \end{align*}

            Postcomposing with the multiplication of $A$ gives us a morphism from to the cofree $C$-comodule $C\otimes_\mathbb{K}A$ to $A$,
            \begin{align*}
                (\cdot_A) \circ (\alpha\otimes id_A) : C \otimes_\mathbb{K} A \rightarrow A\tt{.}
            \end{align*}

            When we apply proposition \ref{prop: free-derivation} to both morphisms, it yields the same map. Therefore it is both a derivation and a coderivation, as
            \begin{align*}
                d_\alpha^r = (id_C\otimes (\cdot_A)) \circ (id_C \otimes \alpha \otimes id_A) \circ (\Delta_C\otimes id_A)
            \end{align*}

                    \node[op, scale=0.75] (a) at (0,0) {$\alpha$};

                    \draw [line width=1pt] (-0.5, 1) -- (-1, 0.5) -- (-1, -1.25);
                    \draw [line width=1pt] (1, 1.25) -- (1, -0.5) -- (0.5, -1);
                    
                \end{tikzpicture}
                \todo{punktum?}
            \end{center}

            One of our main tools will be this coderivation. In the ungraded case it determines a ring morphism with little to no complications.

            \begin{proposition}\label{prop: convolution to endomorphism}
                $d_{\argument}^r:\tt{Hom}_\mathbb{K}(C,A)\rightarrow \tt{End}(C\otimes_\mathbb{K}A)$ is a morphism of algebras. Moreover, if $\alpha\star \alpha = 0$, then $(d_\alpha^r)^2 = 0$.
            \end{proposition}

            \begin{proof}
                The proof quickly follows from (co)associativity and (co)unitality.

            \end{proof}

            This proof relies on braiding, so we will run into some problems when we try to lift this proposition to the graded case. We may observe that the above has no problem lifting, this is because the $\beta$ has no morphisms of odd degrees to the right or over itself. However, the dual will introduce some signs when lifted.

            \begin{corollary}\label{cor: graded-conv-to-end}
                Suppose that $C$ and $A$ are differential graded co/algebras. $d_{\argument}^r : \tt{Hom}_\mathbb{K}^*(C,A) \rightarrow \tt{End}^*(C\otimes_\mathbb{K} A)$ extends to a homogenous ring morphism of degree $0$.
            \end{corollary}

            Suppose that $C$ and $A$ are differential graded (co)algebras. We want to expect that the differential $\partial$ makes $(\tt{Hom}_\mathbb{K}^*(C,A), \star)$ into a dg-algebra.
            
            \begin{proposition}
                The convolution algebra $(\tt{Hom}_\mathbb{K}^*(C,A),\star)$ is a dg-algebra with differential $\partial$.
            \end{proposition}

            \begin{proof}
                We know that $(\tt{Hom}_\mathbb{K}^*(C,A),\star)$ is a convolution algebra and that $(\tt{Hom}_\mathbb{K}^*(C,A),\partial)$ is a chain complex. It remains to verify that the differential is compatible with the multiplication, i.e. $\partial(f\star g) = \partial{f}\star g + (-1)^{|f|}f\star\partial{g}$.

                Let $f,g\in \tt{Hom}_\mathbb{K}^*(C,A)$ be two homogenous morphisms. The key property to arrive at the result is that the differential in a dg-(co)algebra is a (co)derivation. We denote the degree of $f\star g$ as $|f\star g| = |f| + |g| = d$. Then

    \subsection{Twisting Morphisms}

            In this section we will define twisting morphisms from coalgebras to algebras. They are of importance as the bifunctor $\tt{Tw}(C,A)$ is represented in both arguments. To understand the elements of $\tt{Tw}$ we start this section be reviewing the Maurer-Cartan equation.

            Suppose that $C$ is a coaugmented dg-coalgebra and $A$ is an augmented dg-algebra. We say that a morphism $\alpha\in \tt{Hom}_\mathbb{K}^*(C,A)$ is twisting if it is of degree $1$, is $0$ on the coaugmentation of $C$, is $0$ on the augmentation of $A$ and satisfies the Maurer-Cartan equation:
            \begin{align*}
                \partial\alpha + \alpha\star\alpha = 0\text{.}
            \end{align*}
            We say that $\alpha$ is an element of $\tt{Tw}(C,A)\subset \tt{Hom}_\mathbb{K}^{1}(C,A)\subset \tt{Hom}_\mathbb{K}^*(C,A)$. Notice that these requirements means that $\tt{Im}\alpha |_{\overline{C}} \subseteq \overline{A}$. In light of proposition \ref{prop: convolution to endomorphism}, every morphism between (coalgebras) algebras extend to a unique (co)derivation on the tensor product $C\otimes_\mathbb{K}A$. Let $d_\alpha^r$ denote this unique morphism. In the case of dg-coalgebras and dg-algebras we perturbate the total differential on the tensor with $d_\alpha^r$, as in proposition \ref{prop: free-derivation}. We call this derivation for the perturbated derivative,
            \begin{align*}
                d_\alpha = d_{C\otimes_\mathbb{K}A} + d_\alpha^r = d_C\otimes id_A + id_C\otimes d_A + d_\alpha^r\tt{.}
            \end{align*}
            \begin{proposition}\label{prop: twisted-differential}
                Suppose that $C$ is a dg-coalgebra and $A$ is a dg-algebra, and $\alpha\in \tt{Hom}_\mathbb{K}^{-1}(C,A)$. The perturbated derivation satisfies the following relation.
                \begin{align*}
                    {d_\alpha}^2 = d^r_{\partial \alpha + \alpha\star\alpha}
                \end{align*}
                Moreover, a morphism satisfies the Maurar-Cartan equation if and only if its associated perturbated derivative is a differential.
            \end{proposition}

            \begin{proof}
                ${d_\alpha}^2 = d_{C\otimes_\mathbb{K}A} \circ d_\alpha^r + d_\alpha^r \circ d_{C\otimes_\mathbb{K}A} + {d_\alpha^r}^2$. By proposition \ref{prop: dr-dg-hom} the result is immediate.
            \end{proof}

            \begin{corollary}
                If $\alpha:C\rightarrow A$ is a twisting morphism, then $(C\otimes_\mathbb{K}A, d_\alpha^\bullet)$ is a chain complex which is also a left $C$-comodule and a right $A$-module. This is called the right twisted tensor product and is denoted as $C\otimes_\alpha A$.
            \end{corollary}

            Normally $A\otimes C$ and $C\otimes A$ are isomorphic as modules. In general, it is not true that $C\otimes_\alpha A$ and $A\otimes_\alpha C$ are isomorphic, since we have to choose a particular side to perform the twisting. However, if $A$ is commutative and $C$ is cocommutative then they are isomorphic. To illustrate we realize the unique derivation above as a right derivative. The left derivative $d_\alpha^l$ is then defined analogously,
            \begin{center}
                \begin{tikzpicture}[line cap=round,line join=round,>=triangle 45,x=1cm,y=1cm, thick, op/.style={circle, draw, scale=0.75}, diff/.style={regular polygon, draw, regular polygon sides = 3, scale=0.75, rotate = 180}, scale=0.7]

                    \node[op, scale = 0.75] (a) at (2, 0) {$\alpha$};

                    \draw [line width = 1pt] (1, 1.25) -- (1, -0.5) -- (1.5, -1) -- (1.5, -1.25);
                    \draw [line width = 1pt] (2.5, 1.25) -- (2.5, 1) -- (2, 0.5) -- (a) -- (2, -0.5) -- (1.5, -1) -- (1.5, -1.25);
                    \draw [line width = 1pt] (2.5, 1) -- (3, 0.5) -- (3, -1.25);
                    
                \end{tikzpicture}
                \tt{.}
            \end{center}

            $d_{\argument}^l : \tt{Hom}_\mathbb{K}^\bullet(C,A) \rightarrow \tt{End}^\bullet(C,A)$ does no longer define a ring morphism. Note that this still commutes with the differential, the problem lies in the ring homomorphism property. Observe that we get
            \begin{align*}
                d_{\alpha\star\beta}^l = (-1)^{|\alpha||\beta|}d_\beta^l\circ d_\alpha^l\tt{.}
            \end{align*}
            We summarize this in the next proposition.

            \begin{proposition}
                The morphism $d_{\argument}^l : \tt{Hom}_\mathbb{K}^\bullet(C,A) \rightarrow \tt{End}^\bullet(C,A)$ is a skew chain map. 
            \end{proposition}

            \begin{proof}
                This is clear by the previous discussion.
            \end{proof}

            Functoriality of the right twisted tensor at the level of chain maps does not really work. To show where it may go wrong, pick two twisting morphisms $\alpha : C \rightarrow A$ and $\beta : C' \rightarrow A'$. Given a pair of morphisms $f : C \rightarrow C'$ and $g : A \rightarrow A'$, it is not clear if $f\otimes g$ will preserve the perturbated differential, and it should not be true in general.

            It is however the case that the right twisted tensor product defines a tri-functor from the category of elements to chain complexes,
            \begin{align*}
                \argument\otimes_{\argument}\argument : \sum_{\tt{Coalg}\otimes\tt{Alg}}\tt{Tw} \rightarrow \tt{Mod}_C^A\tt{.}
            \end{align*}
            This means that any commutative square as below gets mapped to a morphism of its right twisted tensors. Here $f$ is a morphism of coalgebras and $g$ is a morphism of algebras,
            \begin{center}
                \begin{tikzcd}
                    C \ar[]{r}[]{\alpha} \ar[]{d}[]{f} & A \ar[]{d}[]{g} \\
                    C' \ar[]{r}[]{\alpha '} & A'
                \end{tikzcd}\quad\rightsquigarrow\quad
                \begin{tikzcd}
                    C\otimes_\alpha A \ar[]{d}[]{f\otimes g} \\
                    C'\otimes_{\alpha '} A'
                \end{tikzcd}
                \todo{punktum?}
            \end{center}
            The important property to obtain this is that $f$ and $g$ are morphisms in their respective categories. This allows us to collapse the different compositions to the same map, up to sign.

            % \begin{remark}
            %     Functoriality of $\otimes_\alpha$ is obtained from the category of elements. I propose that there is an equivalence of categories, that is:
            %     \begin{align*}
            %         \int_{(C,A)} \tt{Tw}(C,A) \simeq \text{right twisted tensors.}
            %     \end{align*}
            % \end{remark}

    \subsection{Bar and Cobar Construction}

            The bar construction was first formalized for augmented skew-commutative dg-rings by Eilenberg and Mac Lane \cite{Eilenberg53}. The bar construction then served as a tool to calculate the homology of the Eilenberg-Mac Lane spaces. This construction was later dualized by Adams \cite{Adams56} to obtain the cobar construction. Its first purpose was to serve as a method for constructing an injective resolution in order to calculate the Cotor resolution \cite{Eilenberg65}. With time, the bar-cobar construction have been subjected to much generalization, such as a fattened tensor product on simplicially enriched, tensored and cotensored categories \cite{Riehl14}. We will mainly follow the work of \cite{Loday12} to obtain the bar and cobar construction. The approach which we are going to take is also slightly inspired by MacLanes \cite{MacLane71} canonical resolutions of comonads.

            For our purposes, the bar construction of an augmented algebra is a simplicial resoulution as a cofree coalgebra structure. Given a dg-algebra, we will realize this as the total complex of its resoultion. Dually, the cobar construction of a conilpotent coalgebra is a cosimplicial resolution as a free algebra structure. We will see that these constructions defines an adjoint pair of functors.

            % A monad is a monoid in the monoidal category of endofunctors. This is a functor $M:\mathcal{C}\rightarrow\mathcal{C}$, with natural transformations $\mu:M^2\implies M$ and $\eta:Id_\mathcal{C}\implies M$ called multiplication and unit. The triple $(M, \mu, \eta)$ is a monad whenever it is a monoid, i.e. multiplication satisfies associativity and unit is the unit of the multiplication. Dually a comonad $W:\mathcal{C}\rightarrow\mathcal{C}$ is a triple $(W, \nu, \varepsilon)$ such that it is a comonoid. 

            % \begin{proposition}
            %     Suppose that $W:\mathcal{C}\rightarrow\mathcal{C}$ is comonad. The sequence of functors $(W^{n})_\mathbb{N}$ is an augmented simplicial functor with face and degeneracy maps
            %     \begin{align*}
            %         d_n^i & = W^i\varepsilon_{W^{n-i}} \\
            %         s_n^i & = W^i\nu_{W^{n-i}}\text{.}
            %     \end{align*}

            %     Suppose that $M:\mathcal{C}\rightarrow\mathcal{C}$ is a monad. The sequence of functors $(M^{n})_\mathbb{N}$ is a coaugmented cosimplicial functor with coface and codegeneracy maps
            %     \begin{align*}
            %         d^n_i & = M^i\eta_{M^{n-i}} \\
            %         s^n_i & = M^i\mu_{M^{n-i}}\text{.}
            %     \end{align*}
            % \end{proposition}

            % \begin{proof}
            %     Follows from the universal property of the simplex category, see \cite{MacLane71}.
            % \end{proof}

            % Let $W^?:\Delta^{op}\rightarrow\mathcal{C}$ denote the simplical functor. If $C\in\mathcal{C}$ is an object, then there is a simplical object, denoted $W_C^?$. The face and degeneracy maps are obtained by applying $C$, i.e. $(d_n^i)_C$ and $(s_n^i)_C$. Dually, if $M$ is a monad we obtain a cosimplicial object $M_C^?$.

            % \begin{definition}
            %     Suppose that $\mathcal{A}$ is an abelian category. Let $W:\mathcal{A}\rightarrow\mathcal{A}$ be a comonad and $A$ and object of $\mathcal{A}$. The canonical $W$-projective resolution of $A$ is the chain complex $W^\bullet_A$ together with an augmentation $\varepsilon_A:W^\bullet_A \rightarrow A$.

            %     Dually, suppose that $M:\mathcal{A}\rightarrow\mathcal{A}$ is a monad. The canonical $M$-injective resolution of A is the chain complex $M_A^\bullet$ together with an augmentation $\eta_A:A\rightarrow MA$.
            % \end{definition}

            % \begin{remark}
            %     It makes sense to call these canonical resolutions for projective or injective. Whenever the object $A$ is $W$-projective we get that the augmentation is a quasi-isomorphism. See Weibel for more information.
            % \end{remark}

            % \begin{lemma}\label{lem: adjoints-make-monads}
            %     Suppose that there is an adjoint pair of functors $F: \mathcal{C}\rightleftharpoons\mathcal{D}:G$, where $F$ is left adjoint to $G$. The composite $GF$ is a monad, and $FG$ is a comonad.
            % \end{lemma}

            % We will use this lemma to construct the canonical resolution for algebras. One may observe that this is the same as the Hochschild complex.

            % \begin{example}
            %     Let $A$ be an algebra over the ring $\mathbb{K}$. The functor $A\otimes_\mathbb{K}\argument:Mod_\mathbb{K}\rightarrow Mod_A$ is the free $A$-module over a $\mathbb{K}$-module. Let $U:Mod_A\rightarrow Mod_\mathbb{K}$ denote the forgetfull functor.

            An algebra $A$ is a monoid in the monoidal category $(Mod_\mathbb{K}, \otimes_\mathbb{K}, \mathbb{K})$. By proposition \ref{prop: universal-monoid} we may think of $A$ as an augmented cosimplicial object $A:\Delta_+ \rightarrow Mod_\mathbb{K}$. Notice that all of the cosimplical identities follow from associativity and unitality. If $A$ is an augmented algebra, we may instead give it the structure of an augmented simplicial set. Let $d^0_0 = \varepsilon_A$ be the augmentation. We define $d^n_n = A^{\otimes n-1}\otimes\varepsilon_A$ and set $d^i_n = A^{i-1}\otimes (\cdot_A) \otimes A^{\otimes n-i-1}$. All the degeneracies are set to be the units, i.e. $s^i_n = A^{\otimes i}\otimes \upsilon_A \otimes A^{\otimes n-i-1}$. One may check that this structure defines an augmented simplical object $A:\Delta_+^{op}\rightarrow Mod_\mathbb{K}$. Observe that the chain complex $\tt{C}A$ is exactly the Hochschild complex of $A$. We depict the simplicial object as the following diagram:

            The augmentation ideal $\overline{A}$ carries a natural semi-simplical structure induced by $A$. By restricting each of the face maps ${\overline{d}}^i = d^i {\mid}_{\overline{A}}:\overline{A}^{\otimes n} \rightarrow \overline{A}^{\otimes n-1}$ we obtain the maps together with the simplical identity 1. This is the non-unital Hochschild complex of $A$. We may depict the semi-simplical object as the following diagram:
            \begin{center}

            \end{center}

            As graded modules, the chain complex $\tt{C}\overline{A}$ is isomorphic to $T^c(\overline{A})$. Here we think of the grading $T^c(\overline{A})$ as starting at $0$ and going down to negative degrees. Consider instead the looped non-unital algebra $\overline{A}[1]$. Every algebra may be considered as a graded algebra concentrated in degree $0$, the shift functor then recontextualize the degree the algebra is concentrated in. This object $\overline{A}[1]$ is no longer an associative algebra. In order to understand this looped multiplication we will first consider $\mathbb{K}\startset{\omega}$, where $|\omega| = -1$. We define a looped multiplication $(\cdot):\mathbb{K}\startset{\omega}^{\otimes 2} \rightarrow \mathbb{K}\startset{\omega}$ as
            \begin{align*}
                \omega \cdot \omega = \omega\tt{.}
            \end{align*}
            Given an algebra $A$, the looped multiplication of $A[1]$ is defined as the composite 
            \begin{align*}
                (\cdot_{A[1]}) = ((\cdot) \otimes (\cdot_A)) \circ (\mathbb{K}\startset{\omega} \otimes \beta \otimes \overline{A})\tt{.} 
            \end{align*}
            As an example, suppose that $\omega a_1$ and $\omega a_2$ are elements of $A[1]$, then their multiplication would look like
            \begin{align*}
                (\cdot_{A[1]})(\omega a_1 \otimes \omega a_2) = (-1)^{|a_1||\omega|}((\cdot) \otimes \cdot_{A})(\omega^{\otimes 2} \otimes a_1 \otimes a_2) = (-1)^{|a_1|}\omega a_1 a_2\tt{.}
            \end{align*}
            Observe that the resulting morphism $(\cdot_{A[1]})$ is of degree $1$.

            \begin{proposition}\label{prop: a-to-dgc}
                Suppose that $A$ is an augmented algebra. The differential $d_{\overline{A}[1]}$ is a coderivation for the cofree coalgebra $T^c(\overline{A}[1])$. Thus $(\tt{C}\overline{A}[1], d_{\overline{A}[1]})$ is a dg-coalgebra.
            \end{proposition}

            \begin{proof}
                By injecting $\overline{A}[1]$ into $T^c(\overline{A}[1])$, we may think of $(\cdot_{\overline{A}[1]}) : \overline{A}[1]^{\otimes 2} \rightarrow T^c(\overline{A}[1])$ as a morphism into the tensor coalgebra. By using proposition \ref{prop: tensor-derivation}, $(\cdot_{\overline{A}[1]})$ extends uniquely into a coderivation:
                \begin{align*}
                    d_{\overline{A}[1]}^c = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\sum_{i=0}^n(\cdot_{\overline{A}[1]})_{(i)}^{(n)} = d_{\overline{A}[1]}\text{.}
                \end{align*}
            \end{proof}

            If $(A, d_A)$ is an augmented dg-algebra, then $A$ is a simplical object of $Mod_\mathbb{K}^\bullet$. This also has an associated complex $\tt{C}A$ by taking the alternate sum of face maps. The complex $\tt{C}A$ may be seen to be the total complex of the double complex represented below.

            \end{center}
        
            For simplicity, we will write $d_1$ for the horizontal differential and $d_2$ for the vertical differential. $\tt{C}A$ is thus the total complex of the double complex above. Again we may instead consider the looped algebra $\overline{A}[1]$ to obtain a double complex similar as above. The following lemma states that this double complex is well-defined.
            
            \begin{proposition}
                Let $A$ an augmented dg-algebra. The bar complex $BA$ is the total associated chain complex of the augmentation ideal $\overline{A}$. $(BA, d_{BA}^\bullet)$ is the cofree conilpotent coalgebra equipped with $d_{BA}^\bullet = d_1 + d_2$ as coderivation.
            \end{proposition}

            \begin{proof}
                    It is apparent that $d_1$ and $d_2$ are coderivations with respect to deconcatenation. Since the multiplication $(\cdot_A)$ is a chain map, we should have ${d_{BA}^\bullet}^2 = d_1 \circ d_2 + d_2 \circ d_1= 0$. This will be shown for each element in $A^{\otimes 2}$, the result may then be extended to all of $BA$. Instead of decorating each $a_i$ with an $\omega$ we will follow MacLanes notation and use brackets and bars, $\omega a_1 \otimes \omega a_2 = [a_1 | a_2]$. This is how this coalgebra got its name as the bar construction.

                \begin{multline*}
                    d_1 \circ d_2 [a_1 | a_2] = (-1)^{|a_1|}d_1 [a_1a_2] = (-1)^{|a_1|}d_{A[1]}[a_1a_2] \\ = (-1)^{|a_1|+1}[d_A(a_1a_2)] = (-1)^{|a_1|+1}([d_A(a_1)a_2] + (-1)^{|a_1|}[a_1d_A(a_2)]) \\ = (-1)^{|a_1|+1}[d_A(a_1)a_2] - [a_1d_A(a_2)]
                \end{multline*}
                \begin{multline*}
                    d_2\circ d_1 [a_1 | a_2] = d_2\circ (d_{A[1]}\otimes id_{A[1]} + id_{A[1]}\otimes d_{A[1]}) [a_1\otimes a_2] \\ = -d_2 \circ ([d_A(a_1) | a_2] + (-1)^{|a_1|+1}[a_1 | d_A(a_2)]) \\ = (-1)^{|d_A(a_1)|+1}[d_A(a_1)a_2] + (-1)^{2|a_1|+2}[a_1d_A(a_2)] \\ = (-1)^{|a_1|}[d_A(a_1)a_2] + [a_1d_A(a_2)] = -d_1\circ d_2 [a_1 | a_2]
                \end{multline*}
            \end{proof}

            \begin{remark}
                For now we don't need to show that $BA$ is a functor. This property follows from $BA$ being the representing object of $\tt{Tw}(\argument,A)$.
            \end{remark}

            On the other hand, a coalgebra $C$ is a comonoid in $Mod_\mathbb{K}$. By the dual of proposition \ref{prop: universal-monoid} we may think of it as an augmented simplical object $C:(\Delta_+)^{op} \rightarrow Mod_\mathbb{K}$. Dually, all of the simplical identities follows from coassociativity and counitality. A coaugmented coalgebra $C$ may be given an augmented cosimplicial structure in the opposite way of algebras. We then get that the coaugmentation quotient $\overline{C}$ is a semi-cosimplical object of $Mod_\mathbb{K}$. Observe that $\overline{C}$ has an associated chain complex like $\overline{A}$, but every arrow goes in the opposite direction.

            The cobar construction is made from the suspended coalgebra $C[-1]$. We may also denote suspension by tensoring with a formal generator $s$, such that $|s| = 1$. Then we have an isomorphism $C[-1] \simeq \mathbb{K}\startset{s}\otimes C$. The cobar construction is realized as the free tensor algebra $T(\overline{C}[-1])$, where the comultiplication $\Delta_{\overline{C}[-1]}$ induces a derivation $d_{\overline{C}[-1]}$ by proposition \ref{prop: tensor-derivation}.

            \begin{remark}
                As we have chosen to define $(\cdot_{A[1]})(a_1\otimes a_2)=(-1)^{|a_1|}a_1a_2$, we are forced by the linear dual to define $\Delta_{C[-1]}(c)=-(-1)^{|c_{(1)}|}c_{(1)}\otimes c_{(2)}$. Here we use the Sweedlers notation without sums to denote the comultiplication. Note that this really should be a sum of many different elementary tensors. Lastly, observe that this definition also agrees with Koszuls sign rule.
            \end{remark}

            The associated cochain complex $\tt{C}C$ is the total complex of the double complex below. In the same manner as before, we want to study $C[-1]$ to obtain an analogous result to the bar construction.

            \begin{proposition}
                Let $C$ be a coaugmented dg-coalgebra. The cobar complex $\Omega C$ is the total associated chain complex of the suspended coaugmentation quotient $\overline{C}[-1]$. $(\Omega C, d_{\Omega C})$ is the free algebra equipped with the differential $d_{\Omega C} = d_1 + d_2$ as derivation.
            \end{proposition}

            \begin{proof}
                This proof is similar to the one given for the bar construction.
            \end{proof}

            Given a string of elements in the cobar $sc_1 \otimes \cdots$, we write it by using brackets and bars instead,
            \begin{align*}
                sc_1 \otimes sc_2 \otimes \cdots \otimes sc_n = \langle c_1 | c_2 | \cdots | c_n \rangle\tt{.}
            \end{align*}

            The bar and cobar construction defines an adjoint pair of functors. We want to show that for any conilpotent dg-coalgebra $C$, the object $\Omega C$ represents a functor in the category of augmented algebras. By Yoneda's lemma, $\Omega$ does truly define a functor.

            \begin{thm}\label{thm: cobar-bar-adj}
                Let $C$ be a conilpotent dg-coalgebra and $A$ an augmented dg-algebra. The functor $\tt{Tw}(C,A)$ is represented in both arguments, i.e.
                \begin{align*}
                    \tt{Alg}_{\mathbb{K},+}^\bullet(\Omega C, A)\simeq \tt{Tw}(C, A) \simeq \tt{coAlg}_{\mathbb{K},Conil}^\bullet(C, BA)\text{.}
                \end{align*}
            \end{thm}

            \begin{proof}
                We will show that $\Omega C$ represents the set of twisting morphisms in the first argument. Showing that $BA$ represents the second argument uses every dual proposition. Thus, it is necessary that $C$ is conilpotent, in order to dualize the arguments.

                Suppose that $f:\Omega C \rightarrow A$ is an augmented dg-algebra homomorphism. $f$ is then a morphism of degree $0$. By freeness, $f$ is uniquely determined by a morphism $f\mid_{\overline{C}[-1]}:\overline{C}[-1]\rightarrow \overline{A}$ of degree $0$, which corresponds to a morphism $f':C\rightarrow A$ of degree $1$ which is $0$ on the augmentation and coaugmentation. 

                Since $f$ is a morphism of chain complexes it commutes with the differential, i.e. 
                \begin{align*}
                    f\circ d_{\Omega C} & = d_A\circ f \\
                    \Leftrightarrow\quad f\circ (d_1 + d_2) & = d_A\circ f 
                \end{align*}
                By \ref{prop: free-tensor}, to establish these conditions it is enough to consider the summand where $d_1 = -d_C$ and $d_2 = \overline{\Delta}_{C[-1]}$. Then the right hand side becomes $-f' \circ d_C - (-1)^{|f|}(\cdot_A)(f' \otimes f')\Delta_C$. This is equivalent to say that $-f'\circ d_C - f'\star f' = d_A\circ f'$. Thus $f'$ is a twisting morphism as desired.

                Since every step to establish that $f'$ is a twisting morphism was a logic equivalence, we arrive at the desired conclusion.
            \end{proof}

            For our convenience, we will give these isomorphisms some names. Whenever $\tau : C \rightarrow A$ is a twisting morphism, the induced morphism of algebras is denoted $f_\tau : \Omega C \rightarrow A$ and the induced morphism of coalgebras is denoted $g_\tau : C \rightarrow BA$.

            \begin{remark}
                We could have defined a twisting morphism from any coalgebra $C$ to algebra $A$. In this case we could have defined a twisting morphism as a morphism of degree $1$ which satifies the Cartan-Maurer equation. This definition of twisting morphism is however not represented by the cobar and bar construction on augmented algebras. The subclass of twisting morphisms which also (co)restricts to twisting morphisms on its coaugmentation quotient and augmentation ideal would be represented in this manner. This is simply because our definition requires that a twisting morphism on (co)augmented (co)algebras restricts to twisting morphisms in this new sense.

                The cobar-bar adjunction consists of a composition with the augmentation ideal (quotient) and then the (co)free tensor (co)algebra. By reversing these operations we obtain another adjunction which is more or less the same adjunction. By abuse of language, we will call these functors for the bar and cobar construction as well, and they establish an adjoint pair between non-unital dg-algebras and reduced conilpotent dg-coalgebras. In other words, given a non-unital dg-algebra $A$ and a reduced conilpotent dg-coalgebra $C$, $BA = \overline{T}^c(A[1])$ and $\Omega C = \overline{T}(C[-1])$.

                \end{center}
            \end{remark}

            Associated to this adjunction, we obtain universal elements, together with universal properties. Let $A$ be an augmented dg-algebra, then the identity of the coalgebras $id_{BA} : BA \rightarrow BA$, the counit $\varepsilon_A : \Omega BA \rightarrow A$ and a twisting morphism $\pi_A : BA \rightarrow A$ are equivalent by the adjunction and representation. Dually, the identity of algebras $id_{\Omega C} : \Omega C\rightarrow\Omega C$, the unit $\eta_C : C \rightarrow B\Omega C$ and the twisting morphism $\iota_C : C\rightarrow \Omega C$ are equivalent. The morphisms $\pi_A$ and $\iota_C$ are called the universal elements. We summarize their universal property in the following corollary.

            \begin{corollary}\label{cor: universal-twisting}
                Let $A$ be an augmented dg-algebra, and $C$ a conilpotent dg-coalgebra. Any twisting morphism $\alpha : C \rightarrow A$ factors uniquely through either $\pi_A$ or $\iota_C$.
                
                \begin{center}
                    \begin{tikzcd}
                        & \Omega C \ar[dashed]{rd}[]{g_\alpha}\\

                        & BA \ar[]{ru}[]{\pi_A}
                    \end{tikzcd}
                \end{center}
                Moreover, the morphism $f_\alpha$ is a morphism of dg-coalgebras, and $g_\alpha$ is a morphism of dg-algebras.
            \end{corollary}

            \begin{definition}[Augmented Bar-Cobar construction]
                Let $A$ be an augmented dg-algebra. The (right) augmented bar construction is the right twisted tensor product $BA \otimes_{\pi_A} A$, where $\pi_A$ is the universal twisting morphism.

                Let $C$ be a conilpotent dg-coalgebra. The (right) augmented cobar construction is the right twisted tensor product $C \otimes_{\iota_C} \Omega C$, where $\iota_C$ is the universal twisting morphism.
            \end{definition}

            \begin{remark}
                We could have defined the augmented bar-cobar construction as the left twisted tensor product. There is really no preference of handedness. Whenever we wish to be precise which handedness we will use it will be specified, e.g. the left augmented bar construction of $A$.
            \end{remark}

            \begin{proposition}\label{prop: aug-bar-ac}
                The augmentation ideal and quotient of the augmented bar and cobar construction are acyclic, i.e. $BA \overline{\otimes}_{\pi_A} A$ ($A \overline{\otimes}_{\pi_A} BA$) and $C \overline{\otimes}_{\iota_C}\Omega C$ ($\Omega C \overline{\otimes}_{\iota_C} C$) are acyclic.
            \end{proposition}

            \begin{proof}
                We will postpone this proof until chapter 3. This is a part of the fundamental theorem of twisting morphisms, and will not be relevant until then.
            \end{proof}

    % \subsection{Comparison Lemma}

        % In this section we wish to deduce the fundamental theorem of twisting morphisms. In order to this we will need a result by Henri Cartan \cite{Cartan55}, called the comparison lemma. This section follows Loday \cite{Loday12}, and takes inspiration from Lefevre-Hasagawa \cite{LefevreHasegawa03}.
        
        % In order to state the comparison lemma we need to understand what it means for a dg-algebra to be connected. We define weight, which is a second grading for the objects.

        % \begin{definition}[Weight graded cochain complexes]
        %     Let $N = \startset{0, 1, ...}$ be an indexing set, which is possibly finite. A cochain complex $M$ is weight graded if it splits as a direct sum $M\simeq \bigoplus_{n\in N} M_{(n)}$ indexed over $N$. Let $m\in M$, then $m$ has weight $n$ if $m\in M_{(n)}$, has homological degree $n'$ if $m\in M^{n'}$ and (total) degree $|m| = n + n'$.

        %     A dg-(co)algebra is weight graded if the weight on the cochain complex respects the (co)multiplication. A weight graded dg-(co)algebra will be called a wdg-(co)algebra.
        % \end{definition}

        % \begin{definition}[Connected cochain complexes]
        %     A weight graded cochain complex $M$ is called connected if $M_(0)\simeq \mathbb{K}$ and is concentrated in homological degree $0$. 
        % \end{definition}

        % \begin{lemma}[Comparison Lemma]\label{lem: comparison}
        %     Let $g:A\rightarrow A'$ be a morphism of connected wdg-algebras, and $f:C\rightarrow C'$ be a morphism of connected wdg-coalgebras. Suppose there are twisting morphisms $\alpha: C \rightarrow A$ and $\alpha ':C'\rightarrow A'$ such that $f$ and $g$ becomes a morphism of twisted tensors. If two out of $f$, $g$ and $f\otimes g$ are quasi-isomorphisms, then so is the third.
        % \end{lemma}

        % \begin{proof}
        %     A proof may be found in either Cartans paper \cite{Cartan55} or Loday and Valletes book \cite{Loday12}.
        % \end{proof}

        % \begin{thm}[Fundamental Theorem of Twisting Morphisms I]\label{thm: fundamental-thm-of-twisting}
        %     Let $A$ be a connected wdg-algebra, $C$ be a connected wdg-coalgebra and $\alpha : C\rightarrow A$ a twisting morphism. The following are equivalent:
        %     \begin{enumerate}
        %         \item The augmentation ideal of the right twisted tensor product $C \overline{\otimes}_\alpha A$ is acyclic
        %         \item The augmentation ideal of the left twisted tensor product $A \overline{\otimes}_\alpha C$ is acyclic
        %         \item The morphism $f_\alpha : C \rightarrow BA$ is a quasi-isomorphism
        %         \item The morphism $g_\alpha : \Omega C \rightarrow A$ is a quasi-isomorphism
        %     \end{enumerate}
        % \end{thm}

        % \begin{proof}
        %     In order to do this proof we must first observe that the bar and cobar construction preserve the weight grading, and therefore the connectedness.
            
        %     We prove 1. $\iff$ 3., the other equivalences are analogous. By corollary \ref{cor: universal-twisting}, the morphism $id_C \otimes g_\alpha : C \otimes_{\iota_C} \Omega C \rightarrow C \otimes_{\alpha} A$ is a morphism of twisting tensor products. Since $id_C$ is a quasi-isomorphism, we get by \ref{lem: comparison} that $id_C \otimes g_\alpha$ is a quasi-isomorphism if and only if $g_\alpha$ is a quasi-isomorphism if and only if $\overline{g}_\alpha$ is a quasi-isomorphism. By \ref{prop: aug-bar-ac} $C \overline{\otimes}_{\iota_C} \Omega C$ is acyclic, so $\overline{g}_\alpha$ is a quasi-isomorphism if and only if $C\overline{\otimes}_\alpha A$ is acyclic.
        % \end{proof}

        % \begin{corollary}
        %     Let $A$ be a connected wdg-algebra, $C$ be a connected wdg-coalgebra. The counit $\varepsilon_A : \Omega BA \rightarrow A$, and the unit $\eta_C : C \rightarrow B\Omega C$ are quasi-isomorphisms. 
        % \end{corollary}

        % We now know some cases where the unit and the counit are quasi-isomorphisms. However, we would like to promote this result to every (conilpotent) augmented dg-(co)algebra. To this end we will find suitable filtrations to realize the associated graded as a connected wdg-(co)algebra and then get isomorphisms on the associated graded. The problem would then be to lift such quasi-isomorphisms back to our original objects.

    \section{Strongly Homotopy Associative Algebras and Coalgebras}\label{sec: 1.3}
    \subsection{SHA-Algebras}
        We have seen from corollary \ref{prop: a-to-dgc} that any dg-algebra $A$ defines a dg-coalgebra $T^c(A[1])$, the bar construction, with a coderivation $m^c$ of degree $-1$. Does this however work in reverse? I.e. if $A$ is a vector space such that the coalgebra $T^c(A[1])$ together with a coderivation $m^c$ is a dg-coalgebra, is then $A$ an algebra? The answer to this is no, but it leads to the definition of a strongly homotopy associative algebra.

        \begin{definition}
            An $A_\infty$-algebra is a graded vector space $A$ together with a differential $m:\overline{T}^c(A[1])\rightarrow\overline{T}^c(A[1])$ that is a coderivation of degree $1$.
        \end{definition}

        The differential $m$ induces structure morphisms on $A[1]$. By proposition \ref{prop: tensor-derivation}, there is a natural bijection $\tt{Hom}_\mathbb{K}(\overline{T}^c(A[1]),A[1])\simeq \tt{Coder}(\overline{T}^c(A[1]),\overline{T}^c(A[1]))$ given by the projection onto $A[1]$. Thus $m:\overline{T}^c(A[1])\rightarrow\overline{T}^c(A[1])$ corresponds to maps $\widetilde{m}_n:A[1]^{\otimes n}\rightarrow A[1]$ of degree $1$ for any $n\geq 1$. We define maps $m_n : A^{\otimes n}\rightarrow A$ by the composite $s\widetilde{m}_n \omega^{\otimes n}$. Since $\omega^{\otimes n}$ is of degree $-n$, $\widetilde{m}_n$ and $s$ is of degree $1$, we get that $m_n$ is of degree $2-n$.
        \begin{center}
            \begin{tikzcd}
                A^{\otimes n} \ar[]{r}[]{m_n} \ar[]{d}[]{\simeq}[left]{\omega^{\otimes n}} & A \\
                A[1]^{\otimes n} \ar[]{r}[]{\widetilde{m}_n} & A[1] \ar[]{u}[right]{\simeq}[]{s}
            \end{tikzcd}
        \end{center}

        \begin{proposition}\label{prop: A-infinity def}
            An $A_\infty$-algebra is equivalent to a graded vector space $A$ together with homogenous morphisms $m_n:A^{\otimes n}\rightarrow A$ of degree $2-n$. Moreover, the morphism must satisfy the following relations for any $n\geq 1$:
            \begin{align*}
                (\text{rel}_n)\qquad \sum_{p+q+r = n}(-1)^{pq+r}m_{p+1+r}\circ (id^{\otimes p}\otimes m_q \otimes id^{\otimes r}) = 0
            \end{align*}
        \end{proposition}

        \begin{remark}
            We make a more convenient notation for $(\text{rel}_n)$, called partial composition $\circ_i$,
            \begin{align*}
                & m_{p+1+r} \circ_{p+1} m_q = m_k \circ (id^{\otimes p}\otimes m_q \otimes id^{\otimes r}) \\
                (\text{rel}_n)\qquad & \sum_{p+q+r = n} (-1)^{pq+r} m_{p+1+r} \circ_{p+1} m_q = 0\tt{.}
            \end{align*}
        \end{remark}

        Before starting with the proof, we will need a lemma for checking whether a coderivation \\ $m: T^c(A) \rightarrow T^c(A)$ is a differential.

        \begin{lemma}\label{lem: coderivation-is-diff?}
            Let $m: T^c(A) \rightarrow T^c(A)$ be a coderivation, and denote $m_n = m|_{A^{\otimes n}}$. $m$ is a differential if and only if the following relations are satisfied,
            \begin{align*}
                & \sum_{p+q+r = n}m_{p+1+r}\circ_{p+1}m_q = 0\tt{.}
            \end{align*}
        \end{lemma}

        \begin{proof}
            By proposition \ref{prop: tensor-derivation} we may write $m = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty \sum_{i = 0}^n m_{(n)}^{(i)}$. By using partial composition, we rewrite its $n$'th component as,
            \begin{align*}
                m_n = \sum_{q=1}^n\sum_{p = 1}^n id^{\otimes (n-q)}\circ_{p} m_q = \sum_{p + q + r = n}id^{\otimes (p+1+r)}\circ_{p+1}m_q\tt{.}
            \end{align*}

            For $m^2$ we denote it's $n$'th component as $m^2_n$. Let $\pi : T^c(A) \rightarrow A$ denote the projection onto $A$. Observe the following:
            \begin{align*}
                & m^2_n = m\circ m_n = m\circ \sum_{p + q + r = n}id^{\otimes (p+1+r)}\circ_{p+1}m_q = \sum_{p + q + r = n}m\circ_{p+1}m_q\tt{,} \\
                & \pi m^2_n = \pi \sum_{p + q + r = n}m\circ_{p+1}m_q = \sum_{p + q + r = n}m_{p+1+r}\circ_{p+1}m_q\tt{.}
            \end{align*}
            By \ref{prop: free-derivation}, every coderivation is uniquely determined by $\pi$, we get that $m^2 = 0$ if and only if
            \begin{align*}
                \sum_{p+q+r = n}m_{p+1+r}\circ_{p+1}m_q = 0\tt{.}
            \end{align*}
        \end{proof}

        \begin{proof}[Proof of proposition \ref{prop: A-infinity def}]
            Let $(A,m)$ be an $A_\infty$-algebra. We denote the $n$'th component of $m$ as $\widetilde{m}_n$. The $n$'th components thus define maps $m_n:A^{\otimes n}\rightarrow A$ as $m_n = s\widetilde{m}_n \omega^{\otimes n}$.

            By the above lemma we know that the $n$'th component of $m^2$ is,
            \begin{multline*}
                \sum_{p + q + r = n}\widetilde{m}_{p+1+r}\circ_{p+1}\widetilde{m}_q \\
                = \sum_{p + q + r = n}\omega m_{p+1+r}s^{\otimes (p+1+r)}\circ_{p+1}\omega m_qs^{\otimes q} = \sum_{p + q + r = n}(-1)^{pq+r}\omega m_{p+1+r}\circ_{p+1}m_q s^{\otimes n}\tt{.}
            \end{multline*}

            The last equation is given by applying proposition \ref{prop: multi-koszul-sign} twice. In other words, we want to find a parity $p = p_1 + p_2$ which determines the sign above. To get $p_1$ we start with moving the $s$ on the left,
            \begin{align*}
                s^{\otimes p + 1 + r} \circ (id^{\otimes p} \otimes \omega m_q s^{\otimes q} \otimes id^{\otimes r}) = (-1)^{p_1}(s^{\otimes q} \otimes m_q s^{\otimes q} \otimes s^{\otimes r})\tt{.}
            \end{align*}
            By proposition \ref{prop: multi-koszul-sign},
            \begin{align*}
                p_1 = \sum_{i=1}^n\sum_{1\leq j < i}(\tt{if }j = p+1\tt{ then }1\tt{ otherwise }0) = r\tt{.}
            \end{align*}

            In the next step we separate the $s$ on the right,
            \begin{align*}
                (id^{\otimes p}\otimes m_q \otimes id^{\otimes r}) \circ s^{\otimes n} = (-1)^{p_2}(s^{\otimes q}\otimes m_qs^{\otimes q}\otimes s^{\otimes r})\tt{.}
            \end{align*}
            We calculate $p_2$ to be,
            \begin{align*}
                p_2 = (2-q)\sum_{1\leq j < p+1}1 = 2p - qp\tt{.}
            \end{align*}
            Thus the parity of $p$ is $p = 2p - qp + r = pq + r$ modulo $2$.

            Since suspension and loop are isomorphisms, we get that $m^2 = 0$ if and only if $(\text{rel}_n)$ are $0$ for every $n\geq 1$, i.e.
            \begin{align*}
                \sum_{p+q+r = n} (-1)^{pq+r} m_{p+1+r} \circ_{p+1} m_q = 0\tt{.}
            \end{align*}
        \end{proof}

        Given an $A_\infty$ algebra $A$, we may either think of it as a differential tensor coalgebra $\overline{T}^c(A[1])$ with differential $m: \overline{T}^c(A[1])\rightarrow \overline{T}^c(A[1])$, or as a graded vector space with morphisms $m_n:A^{\otimes n} \rightarrow A$ satisfying $(\text{rel}_n)$. We will calculate $(\text{rel}_n)$ for $n=1,2,3$:
        \begin{align*}
            (\text{rel}_1)\qquad & m_1\circ m_1 = 0 \\
            (\text{rel}_2)\qquad & m_1\circ m_2 - m_2\circ_{1}m_1 - m_2\circ_2m_1 = 0 \\
            (\text{rel}_3)\qquad & m_1\circ m_3 - m_2\circ_1 m_2 + m_2\circ_2m_2 + m_3\circ_1m_1 + m_3\circ_2m_1 + m_3\circ_3m_1 = 0 
        \end{align*}

        We see that $(\text{rel}_1)$ states that $m_1$ should be a differential. Thus we may think of $(A, m_1)$ as a chain complex. Furthermore, $(\text{rel}_2)$ says that $m_2 : (A^{\otimes 2}, m_1\otimes id_A + id_A\otimes m_1) \rightarrow (A, m_1)$ is a morphism of chain complexes. Lastly, $(\text{rel}_3)$ gives us a homotopy for the associator of $m_2$, namely $m_3$. Thus we may regard $(A, m_1, m_2)$ as an algebra which is associative up to the homotopy $m_3$. Regarding $A$ as a chain complex instead we obtain our final definition of an $A_\infty$-algebra.

        \begin{proposition}
            Suppose that $(A, d)$ is a chain complex, and that there exists morphisms $m_n: A^{\otimes n} \rightarrow A$ of degree $2-n$ for any $n\geq 2$. A is an $A_\infty$-algebra if and only it satisfies the following relations:
            \begin{align*}
                (\text{rel'}_n)\qquad & \partial(m_n) = -\sum_{\substack{n = p + q + r \\ k = p + 1 + r \\ k > 1, q > 1}}(-1)^{pq + r}m_k\circ_{p+1}m_q
            \end{align*}
        \end{proposition}

        We define the homotopy of an $A_\infty$-algebra to be the homology of the chain complex $(A, m_1)$. Since $\partial(m_3) = m_2\circ_1m_2 - m_2\circ_2m_2$, we get that $m_2$ is associative in homology. Thus for any $A_\infty$-algebra $A$, the homotopy $HA$ is an associative algebra. The operadic homology of $A$ is defined as the homology of $(T^c(A[1]), m)$, which is the non-unital augmented Hochschild homology of $A$.

        \begin{example}
            Suppose that $V$ is a cochain complex with differential $d$. Then $V$ is an $A_\infty$-algebra with trivial multiplication. In other words $m^1 = d$ and $m^i = 0$ for any $i>1$.
        \end{example}

        \begin{example}
            Suppose that $A$ is a dg-algebra. Then $A$ is an $A_\infty$-algebra where $m^1 = d$, $m^2 = (\cdot)$ and $m^i=0$ for any $i>2$.
        \end{example}

        \begin{example}
            Let $A$ be a connected weight-graded algebra over $\mathbb{K}$. We may then think of $\mathbb{K}$ as an $A$-module with trivial action, i.e. as the quotient $\sfrac{A}{A^{(i)}}_{(i\geq 1)}$, then $Ext^*_A(\mathbb{K},\mathbb{K})$ is an $A_\infty$-algebra. This was shown by Lu, Palmari, Wu and Zhang \cite{Lu06}.
        \end{example}

        Next we want to understand the category of $A_\infty$-algebras. A morphism between $A_\infty$-algebras is called an $\infty$-morphism. We define such an $\infty$-morphism $f:A\rightsquigarrow B$ between $A_\infty$-algebras as associated dg-coalgebra homomorphism $Bf:(\overline{T}^c(A[1]), m^A)\rightarrow (\overline{T}^c(B[1]), m^B)$. Here $Bf$ is purely formal, we will make sense of this soon.

        \begin{proposition}
            Let $A,B$ be two $A_\infty$-algebras. A collection of morphisms $f_n : A^{\otimes n} \rightarrow B$ of degree $1-n$ for any $n \geq 1$ defines an $\infty$-morphism $f : A \rightsquigarrow B$ if and only if $f_1$ is a morphism of chain complexes and for any $n\geq 2$ the following relations are satisfied:
            \begin{align*}
                & (\text{rel}_n)\qquad \partial(f_n) = \sum_{\substack{p + 1 + r = k \\ p + q + r = n}}(-1)^{pq+r}f_k\circ_{p+1}m^A_q - \sum_{\substack{k\geq 2 \\ i_1 + ... + i_k = n}}(-1)^{e}m^B_k \circ (f_{i_1}\otimes f_{i_2}\otimes ... \otimes f_{i_k})\tt{,}
            \end{align*}
            where $e$ is given as
            \begin{align*}
                e = \sum_{l = 1}^k(1-i_l)\sum_{1\leq m < l}i_m\tt{.}
            \end{align*}
        \end{proposition}
        
        \begin{proof}
            Establishing the shape of this equation is immediate by the universal property of cofree coalgebras. The parity $e$ is obtained by factorizing out the $s$ on the right.
            \begin{align*}
                (f_{i_1} \otimes \cdots \otimes f_{i_k}) \circ s^{\otimes n} = (-1)^e(f_{i_1}s^{\otimes i_1} \otimes \cdots \otimes f_{i_k}s^{\otimes i_k})\tt{.}
            \end{align*}
            By proposition \ref{prop: multi-koszul-sign}, we arrive at the conclusion,
            \begin{align*}
                e = \sum_{l = 1}^k|f_{i_l}|\sum_{1\leq m < l}|s^{\otimes i_m}|= \sum_{l = 1}^k(1- i_l)\sum_{1 \leq m < l}i_m
            \end{align*}
        \end{proof}

        Since the composition of two dg-coalgebra homomorphisms is again a dg-coalgebra homomorphism, we get that the composition of two $\infty$-morphisms is again an $\infty$-morphism. More explicitly if $f:A\rightsquigarrow B$ and $g: B\rightsquigarrow C$ are two $\infty$-morphisms, then their composition is defined as
        \begin{align*}
            (fg)_n = \sum_r\sum_{i_1 + ... + i_r = n} (-1)^eg_r(f_{i_1}\otimes ... \otimes f_{i_r})\text{.}
        \end{align*}

        Here $e$ denotes the same parity as above.

        \begin{definition}
            An $\infty$-morphism $f: A\rightsquigarrow B$ is called strict if $f_n = 0$ for any $n\geq 2$. 
        \end{definition}

        \begin{definition}
            $\tt{Alg}_\infty$ denotes the category of $A_\infty$-algebras, and the morphisms in this category are the $\infty$-morphisms.
        \end{definition}

        Observe that we may extend the bar construction to $B : \tt{Alg}_\infty \rightarrow \tt{Co\tt{Alg}}_{\mathbb{K},conil}^\bullet$ to a fully fatihful functor. This may be done explicitly by using proposition \ref{prop: tensor-derivation}. The subcategory of the essential image is the full subcategory of every almost cofree dg-coalgebra. Notice that the bar construction on the category of dg-algebras is a non-full injection into the category of $A_\infty$-algebras. This inclusion gives us a recontextualization of a dg-algebra as an $A_\infty$-algebra.

        A quasi-isomorphism between $A_\infty$-algebras is called an $\infty$-quasi-isomorphism. Given an $\infty$-morphism $f: A\rightsquigarrow B$, then we say that it is an $\infty$-quasi-isomorphism if $f_1$ is a quasi-isomorphism. If we wanted to be more stringent with this definition, we would want an $\infty$-quasi-isomorphism to be an $\infty$-morphism which is a quasi-isomorphism of dg-coalgebras. We will later see that these definitions are equivalent.

        A homotopy between two $A_\infty$-algebras is a homotopy between the dg-coalgebras they define. We may however trace this definition back along the quasi-inverse of the bar construction to get a new definition in terms of many morphisms. \todo{Er dette i det hele tatt riktig?} Let $f,g: A\rightsquigarrow B$ be two $\infty$-morphisms, we say that $f-g$ is null-homotopic if there is a collection of morphisms $h_n : A^{\otimes n} \rightarrow B$ of degree $n$ such that the following relations are satisfied for any $n \geq 1$:
        \begin{multline*}
            f_n - g_n = \sum (-1)^s m^B_{r+1+t}\circ (f_{i_1}\otimes ... \otimes f_{i_r} \otimes h_k \otimes g_{j_1} \otimes ... \otimes g_{j_t}) +  \sum (-1)^{j+kl}h_i \circ_{j+1} m_k^A\tt{.}

        As in the same case for algebras, there is also a notion of unital $A_\infty$-algebras and augmented $A_\infty$-algebras. For this discussion it is important to note that the field $\mathbb{K}$ is also an $A_\infty$-algebra. This algebra will serve as the initial algebra, in the same way as it does for ordinary algebras.

        \begin{definition}\label{def: strict-unit}
            A strictly unital $A_\infty$-algebra is an $A_\infty$-algebra $A$ together with a unit morphism $\upsilon_A : \mathbb{K} \rightarrow A$ of degree $0$ such that the following are satisfied:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item $m_1\circ \upsilon_A = 0$.
                \item $m_2(id_A \otimes \upsilon_A) = id_A = m_2(\upsilon_A\otimes id_A)$.
                \item $m_i \circ_k \upsilon_A = 0$ for any $i\geq 3$ and $1 \leq k < i$.
            \end{itemize}
        \end{definition}

        A strictly unital $\infty$-morphism $f: A \rightsquigarrow B$ between strictly unital $A_\infty$-algebras is a morphism which preserves the unit. This means that $f_1\upsilon_A = \upsilon_B$ and $f_i \circ_k \upsilon_A = 0$ for any $i \geq 2$ and $1 \leq k < i$. The collection of strictly unital $A_\infty$-algebras and strictly unital $\infty$-morphisms form a non-full subcategory of $A_\infty$-algbras. A strict $\infty$-morphism which is unital at the level of chain complexes is automatically stricly unital. Strict unital will then mean strict and strictly unital. Note that $\mathbb{K}$ is strictly unital where the unit is $id_\mathbb{K}$.

        \begin{definition}\label{def: augmented-sha}
            An augmented $A_\infty$-algebra is a strictly unital $A_\infty$-algebra $A$ together with a strict unital morphism $\varepsilon_A : A \rightarrow \mathbb{K}$. The $\infty$-morphism $\varepsilon_A$ is called the augmentation of $A$.
        \end{definition}

        The collection of augmented $A_\infty$-algebras and strictly unital morphism is the category of augmented $A_\infty$-algebras, denoted as $\tt{Alg}_{\infty,+}$. As in the same way for algebras, there is an equivalence of categories $\tt{Alg}_\infty \simeq \tt{Alg}_{\infty,+}$. The augmentation ideal, or the reduced $A_\infty$-algebra is the kernel of the augmentation $\varepsilon_A$. A priori, it does not make sense to talk about this limit as we do not know if it exists. However, we will see in section 2.3.3 that such morphisms does in fact have a kernel. This defines a functor, $\overline{\underline{\phantom{A}}} : \tt{Alg}_{\infty ,+} \rightarrow \tt{Alg}_\infty$, where $Ker\varepsilon_A = \overline{A}$. The quasi-inverse to this functor is given by free augmentations. Given an $A_\infty$-algebra $A$, we may construct the $A_\infty$-algebra $A\oplus \mathbb{K}$. The structure morphisms are given by $m_i^A$, but there is now a unit $\upsilon_{A\oplus\mathbb{K}}$. Thus we get that $m_1(1) = 0$, $m_2 (a\otimes 1) = a$ and $m_i \circ_k 1 = 0$ in the same manner. We obtain a functor $\argument^+ : \tt{Alg}_\infty \rightarrow \tt{Alg}_{\infty, +}$, where $A\oplus \mathbb{K} = A^+$.

    \subsection{$A_\infty$-Coalgebras}    
        Dual to $A_\infty$-algebras we got conilpotent $A_\infty$-coalgebras. Here we instead ask ourselves if the cobar construction has some converse, i.e. if $C$ is a graded vector space such that $T(C[-1])$ together with a derivation $m$ is a dg-algebra, is then $C$ a coalgebra? Again, the answer to this is no, but we do obtain a definition for conilpotent $A_\infty$-coalgebras.

        \begin{definition}
            A graded vector space $C$ is called a conilpotent $A_\infty$-coalgebra if it is a dg-algebra of the form $(\overline{T}(C[-1]), d)$ where $d$ is a derivation of degree $1$.
        \end{definition}

        \begin{remark}
            For the rest of this thesis, an $A_\infty$-coalgebra should be understood as a conilpotent $A_\infty$-coalgebra unless otherwise specified.
        \end{remark}

        \begin{corollary}
            $C$ is an $A_\infty$-coalgebra with differential $d$ then there is a chain complex $(C, d^1)$, where $d^1$ is of degree $1$, and together with morphisms $d^n : C \rightarrow C^{\otimes n}$ such that $d$ uniquely determines each $d^i$ for any $i>0$. Conversely, if the morphisms $d^i$ satisfy $\text{(rel)}_n$, then they uniquely determine a $d$ such that $C$ is an $A_\infty$-coalgebra,
            \begin{align*}
                (\text{rel}_n)\tt{ is}\qquad & \sum_{p+q+r = n}(-1)^{pq+r}d^{p+1+q}\circ^{op}_{p+1}d^q = 0
            \end{align*}
        \end{corollary}

        A morphism of $A_\infty$-coalgebras would be defined in the same manner, but opposite. An $\infty$-morphism $f: C \rightsquigarrow D$ is then either a morphism $\widetilde{f}: (T(C[-1]), m^C) \rightarrow (T(D[-1]),m^D)$ of dg-algebras; or equivalently it is a collection of morphisms $f_n : C \rightarrow D^{\otimes n}$ of degree $1-n$ such that $f_1$ is a morphism of chain complexes, and for any $n\geq 2$ the following relations are satisfied:
        \begin{align*}
            & (\text{rel}_n)\qquad \partial(f_n) = \sum_{\substack{p + 1 + r = k \\ p + q + r = n}}(-1)^{pq+r}f_k\circ^{op}_{p+1}m^D_q - \sum_{\substack{k\geq 2 \\ i_1 + ... + i_k = n}}(-1)^{e}m^C_k \circ^{op} (f_{i_1}\otimes f_{i_2}\otimes ... \otimes f_{i_k})\tt{,}
        \end{align*}
        where $e$ is given as
        \begin{align*}
            e = \sum_{l = 1}^k(1-i_l)\sum_{1\leq m < l}i_m\tt{.}
        \end{align*}

        We denote $\tt{coAlg}_\infty$ as the category of $A_\infty$-coalgebras. In the same manner, the cobar construction extends to this category and gives us an identification of $A_\infty$-coalgebras and a subcategory of dg-algebras. This subcategory consists of every dg-algebra that is isomorphic, as an algebra, to a free tensor algebra. Lastly, every dg-coalgebra is an $A_\infty$-coalgebra by letting every morphism $m^i = 0$ where $i>2$. This gives a non-full inclusion.
