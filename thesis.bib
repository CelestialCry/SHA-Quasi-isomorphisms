  abstract = {The category of unital (unbounded) dg cocommutative coalgebras over a field of characteristic zero is provided with a structure of simplicial closed model category. This generalizes the model structure defined by Quillen in 1969 for 2-reduced coalgebras. In our case, the notion of weak equivalence is structly stronger than that of quasi-isomorphism. A pair of adjoint functors connecting the category of coalgebras with the category of dg Lie algebras, induces an equivalence of the corresponding homotopy categories. The model category structure allows one to consider dg coalgebras as the most general formal stacks. The corresponding Lie algebra is then interpreted as a tangent Lie algebra which defines the formal stack uniquely up to a weak equivalence. As an example, we calculate the coalgebra of formal deformations of a principal G-bundle on a scheme X.}

  abstract = {We survey the basics of homological algebra in exact categories in the sense of Quillen. All diagram lemmas are proved directly from the axioms, notably the five lemma, the 3Ã3-lemma and the snake lemma. We briefly discuss exact functors, idempotent completion and weak idempotent completeness. We then show that it is possible to construct the derived category of an exact category without any embedding into abelian categories and we sketch Deligne's approach to derived functors. The construction of classical derived functors with values in an abelian category painlessly translates to exact categories, i.e., we give proofs of the comparison theorem for projective resolutions and the horseshoe lemma. After discussing some examples we elaborate on Thomason's proof of the GabrielâQuillen embedding theorem in an appendix.}
